# GTFS Governance

The GTFS Specification is not set in stone. Instead, it is an open specification developed and maintained by the community of transit agencies, developers, and other stakeholders who use GTFS. It is expected that this community of producers and consumers of GTFS data will have proposals for extending the spec to enable new capabilities.

To formalize this process, we've established the following GTFS Governance frameworks:

-   [GTFS Schedule - Governance Framework](/gtfs/Governance/introduction.md)

-   [GTFS Realtime - Governance Framework](gtfs-realtime/CHANGES.md)

## Before you contribute
Before we can use your code, you must sign the
[Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual)
(CLA), which you can do online. 

The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also need to be sure of various other things for instance that you'll tell us if you know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase. Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid frustration later on.

### The small print
Contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than the one above, the [Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate).
