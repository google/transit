# Trip Modifications

A `TripModifications` message identifies a list of similar `trip_ids` from the (CSV) GTFS which are all affected by particular modifications, such as a detour.

<br><br>**Caution:** this entity is still **experimental**, and subject to change. It may be formally adopted in the future.

## SLO: Service-level objective

The frequency of data updates is expected to be approximately hourly (~24 times/day). Ingestion time may depend on the total number of affected trips. Consumers are expected to ingest a single TripModification within 5 minutes, and a feed with hundreds of detours within 20 minutes.

## TripModifications

The `TripModifications` is in effect on all of the listed service\_dates, until it is removed from the feed. On any given service date, a trip MUST NOT be assigned to more than one `TripModifications` object.

There MAY be multiple `TripModifications` for a given stop pattern. It may be desirable to split the trips into multiple modifications e.g. if the `propagated_modification_delay` changes significantly, over the course of the detour.

The trips created through GTFS-TripModifications modify and replace each specified `trip_id`, and don't create a copy or additional run. Modifications are applied on the schedule information, like if a static GTFS (CSV) was modified. 

The scheduled stop times of each replacement trip are created from those of the affected trip, by performing the changes listed in modifications. `stop_sequence` for all stop times are replaced by a new value of 1 to n, starting with 1 on the first stop_time and increasing by 1 for each stop in the trip. A `TripUpdate` message must be provided to publish real-time arrival/departure times for the replacement trip.


## Linkage to TripUpdates

* A TripUpdate SHOULD be provided using a `ModifiedTripSelector` inside the TripUpdate's `TripDescriptor`. 
    * When the TripUpdate refers to the replacement trip, the consumer should behave as if the static GTFS would have been modified with the TripModifications (e.g. `arrival_time`, `departure_time`, `stop_sequence`, `stop_id` on replacement stops).
    * When providing a `ModifiedTripSelector`, the other fields of the `TripDescriptor` MUST be left empty, to avoid confusion by consumers that aren't looking for the `ModifiedTripSelector` value. 
    * TripUpdate feeds providing updates with `ModifiedTripSelector` SHOULD also include a TripUpdate targeting clients that don't support TripModifications. In other words, there should be two TripUpdates: one for clients with modified trips (with `TripModifications`) and one for clients with the originial unmodified GTFS (without `TripModifications`).
    * Providing a TripUpdate with a `ModifiedTripSelector` is the only way to create predictions at replacement stops.
* If no such TripUpdate is found, TripUpdates for the original `trip_id` will apply to the modified trip. 
    * In this case, the static GTFS information used should be from the static GTFS before any TripModifications applied. 
    * Real time information can be available to the common stops between the previous trip and the new modified trip; however, no ETA would be available at the replacement stops.

##  Modification

A `Modification` message describes changes to each affected trip starting at `start_stop_selector`. There can be zero, one, or more than one stop time(s) replaced by a `Modification`. The spans of the modifications MUST not overlap. Spans may not be contiguous; in this case the two modifications MUST be merged into one.  These stop times are replaced with a new stop time for each replacement stop described by `replacement_stops`.

The sequence of `replacement_stops` may be of arbitrary length. For example, 3 stops could be replaced by 2, 4, or 0 stops as the situation may require.

_Propagated detour delays affect all stops following the end of a modification. If a trip has multiple modifications, the delays are accumulated._

## ReplacementStop

Each `ReplacementStop` message defines a stop that will now be visited by the trip, and optionally specifies the estimated travel time to the stop. The `ReplacementStop` message is used to construct the scheduled `stop_time` for the stop.

When `travel_time_to_stop` is specified, the `arrival_time` is calculated from a reference stop in the original trip, plus the offset in `travel_time_to_stop`. Otherwise, the `arrival_time` can be be interpolated based on the total duration of the modification in the original trip.

The `departure_time` always equals the `arrival_time`.

The optional fields of [`stop_times.txt`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/spec/en/reference.md#stop_timestxt) in the (CSV) GTFS specification are all set to their default values.

_If a modification affects the first stop of the trip, that stop also serves as the reference stop of the modification._
