In https://github.com/google/transit/pull/405 where `networks.txt` and `route_networks.txt` were proposed, the community decided to keep a separation between `network_id` in `routes.txt` on one side and `networks.txt+route_networks.txt` on the other side (to maintain backward compatibility since the features were introduced at different times).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Describe the Problem\r\nThe spec mention clearly [in the dataset section](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/spec/en/reference.md#dataset-files:~:text=stops%20to%20areas.-,networks.txt,-Conditionally%20Forbidden) that `networks.txt` and `route_networks.txt `are forbidden if `network_id` exists in rou`tes.txt`. However, for `network_id` in `routes.txt` itself, it only says that the field is forbidden if `route_networks.txt` exists (ONLY, and not `networks.txt` as well).\r\n\r\n## Use Cases\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\nAdd `networks.txt` to files that forbid the existence of `network_id` in `routes.txt`\r\n\r\nThis is a documentation change, since the change is just to maintain consistency in the reference file.\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\n<!--Please select the relevant change type.--> \r\n\r\nGTFS Schedule\r\n- [ ] Functional Change\r\n- [ ] Non-Functional Change\r\n- [x] Documentation Maintenance\r\n\r\nGTFS Realtime\r\n- [ ] Specification Change\r\n- [ ] Specification Change (Experimental Field)\r\n\r\n## Proposed Discussion Period\r\nIn compliance with the governance, I propose a 7-day discussion period followed by 7 days for reviewing.

    "body": "### Describe the problem\n\nThere seems to be information being entered by agency staff but missing from the GTFS-TripModifications messages. SimplifyTransit has spoken with agencies about this data, and we'd like that information included in the Trip Updates feed for all Consumers. Specifically:\n\n- The Cause for the Modification\n- The days and time periods when the Modification is happening (I'm calling this DayTimePeriod for lack of a better term), if it's not all day during the service_dates range (common with construction-related detours)\n\n### Use cases\n\nThis would allow Consumers to understand more clearly how and when to display an alert to riders, as well as clearly and transparently link a Trip Modification relates to a related Service Alert. \n\nWithout being specific, as we are with other agency entries that lead to Trip Modifications data, there's ambiguity that negatively impacts riders.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSimplifyTransit isn't a producer of this data, so I'd look to GTFS-TripModifications Producers to recommend the best solution. Here's what I have in mind so far:\n\n1. **Add a TripModifications.Cause for each Modification**, using the same values from ServiceAlerts.Cause for consistency and clarity between the data feeds. Specify that any Service Alerts related to this Trip Modification must use the same Cause value.\n2. **Expand TripModifications.service_dates to include days of the week and time ranges** within those days when the Modification is happening (I'm calling this DayTimePeriod for lack of a better term), if it's not all day during the service_dates range (common with construction-related detours).\n3. These fields would be Optional, but the spec would **Require** that Producers who give agency staff fields to enter this structured data **must** provide that data publicly in the Trip Updates feed. If a Producer doesn't give agency staff a way to enter that data, they are recommended to create those fields to supply this data.\n\nPlease suggest better approaches and solutions, particularly if you're familiar with how agencies create this data with your product, or will in the future.\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

I'm open to feedback and discussion on this, and assure the community I do not take this topic lightly.\r\n\r\n## Describe the Problem\r\nCurrently, the GTFS and GTFS-realtime decision-making process includes the term \"unanimous consensus\" that is impossible to achieve because \"unanimity\" and \"consensus\" are two inherently different decision standards. Moreover, the perception that unanimity is or should be required leads to a small minority (possibly even just one contributor) having the ability to block consensus or progress that is generally favored by the GTFS community. \r\n\r\nThis hinders our ability to help the riders and agencies we're here to serve.\r\n\r\n## Use Cases\r\nThe changes in this PR would apply to all changes to GTFS-schedule and GTFS-realtime specs that are proposed after they are formally adopted.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\n\r\n-  Replaces \"unanimous consensus,\" an inherently self-contradictory term, with \"consensus\" in some instances and \"qualified majority\" in other instances. \r\n- Lowers the bar for testing proposed changes, while keeping a reasonably high bar for formal adoption. \r\n- Defines \"consensus\" in the Guiding Principles of both GTFS-schedule and GTFS-realtime, as well as specifying how a contributor can declare their reservations/objections in a consensus process.\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\n<!--Please select the relevant change type.--> \r\n\r\nGTFS Schedule\r\n- [X] Functional Change\r\n- [X] Non-Functional Change\r\n- [X] Documentation Maintenance\r\n\r\nGTFS Realtime\r\n- [X] Specification Change\r\n- [ ] Specification Change (Experimental Field)\r\n\r\n## Additional Information\r\n<!--Include any relevant background, context, or supporting details that may help reviewers understand the rationale behind this proposal. This could include links to discussions, technical documentation, or related proposals.-->\r\n\r\n## Proposed Discussion Period\r\nGiven the scale and scope of these proposals, I expect we'll need a month of discussion.

It includes:\r\n1) Adding Network Set Predicates to match effective fare legs to rules in `fare_leg_rules.txt`. These network sets are defined in `network_sets.txt` and mapped to routes in `network_set_elements.txt`.\r\n2) For Network Sets to be usable, it is necessary to relax the constraint that only legs with the same network can be joined in `fare_leg_join_rules.txt`. By allowing leg joins across different networks, the effective fare leg will contain multiple `network_ids`.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis proposal was discussed and its scope was defined in multiple Fares v2 Working Group meetings.

    "body": "### Describe the problem\n\nIn https://github.com/google/transit/pull/418, the `rule_priority` field was added to the GTFS specification, along with a new set of matching semantics for calculating the price of a given fare leg. As part of this change, the correct interpretation of the `rule_priority` field depends on _whether or not the field is included in the file's header_. If `rule_priority` is included in the header, an empty value means `rule_priority=0` for that row, and the row applies to all networks/areas/etc. if those are not defined, but if the header is not included, rule_priority is essentially `empty` instead of 0, and the matching rules are completely different. After a year or so of ingesting fares-v2 files since this change (which, it should be mentioned, we [supported](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/418#discussion_r1589652857)!), we've noticed that this condition is dangerous at best, and given the spec, seems unnecessary.\n\nFor data consumers (such as ourselves at Transit), this becomes an annoyance when reading in such files. It should be noted that a guiding principle of the GTFS spec is that the spec should be as \"database-friendly\" as possible; for us, having the meaning of a row change on whether or not the original file included a field in its header is a headache, since the most logical and obvious way of handling missing fields/values in any csv-based format is to treat their values as undefined. (If you're designing a database that handles more than one producer's flavour of GTFS, you necessarily coalesce fields that one producer doesn't include to `empty`, so that you correctly import when the other producer includes them).\n\nAdditionally, we notice that producers (and producers can correct me if I'm misinterpreting!) often will include all or many of the GTFS specification's headers in a given file, even if they don't use some or many of them. This is normal practice as far as I can tell, but runs the risk of breaking their fares-v2 when \"correctly\" interpreted by consumers such as ourselves.\n\nWith the original fare_leg_rules.txt, GTFS gained a new type of semantics that was already relatively complicated - the idea that an empty field could refer to all of the valid values not mentioned in that field, elsewhere in the file. This is a new snag in the specification that I can see leading to misunderstanding, and I argue that it is unnecessary.\n\n### Use cases\n\nEnsure that the spec is as clear as possible to avoid mistakes during the creation and interpretation of fares-v2 data.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThe simplest way around this is to remove the \"defaulting\" behaviour to 0 on `rule_priority`. If so, the matching rules for a given row in fare_leg_rules.txt could be correctly derived from reading that row _alone_, without needing to infer context from the original file's headers: If the `rule_priority` field has a number, then empty network/areas do not affect matching; if the field is empty, then empty network/areas fields refer to all unmentioned area_ids in the file. The corollary benefit to such a change is that the meaning of the field could be correctly understood from reading the field's definition in the spec, rather than having to reconcile it with the preamble at the top of `fare_leg_rules.txt`, as well as the further appendix that defines what \"existing\" means for a given field.\n\nIf it is considered that such a change would be too breaking and thus unsafe, then I propose that the spec should be further clarified, both in the preamble to fare_leg_rules.txt, and in the `rule_priority` field's definition. In the field's definition,\n>An empty value for rule_priority is treated as zero.\n\nshould be changed to something like\n\n>If the `rule_priority` field is defined in the header, an empty value for rule_priority is treated as zero.\n\nAdditionally, the oft-used verbiage of `If the rule_priority field exists in the file` is unclear (even if defined in an auxiliary location in the spec, which I assume goes unread since it's not something that _sounds_ like it needs to be further defined). I can easily see this being interpreted as `if there are no defined rule_priority values in the file`. I understand that this wording was used to make an already-long spec somewhat more readable, but the trade-off on clarity here is lopsided. Where this wording is used, it should be replaced to be explicit that it's talking about whether or not the file contains `rule_priority` in the header.\n\nLastly, I strongly advocate that the GTFS specification going forward should refrain from using semantics based on the presence of a field in a file's header, for the reasons stated above: notably, that it is confusing for producers and consumers alike, and that it can be easily corrected by a more appropriate data type for the concerned field(s).\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "### Describe the problem\n\nIt is not possible to model certain common operational scenarios with the existing GTFS-RT alerts spec. When certain alerts are published, such as alerts describing rail suspensions between specific stations or alerts describing bypassed stops, the information available to consumers about what services are unavailable in a given direction at a given station is limited and can lead to misinformation and/or rider confusion.\n\n### Use cases\n\n## Theoretical examples\n\n### Case 1. Service suspension in both directions between specific stations\n\n<img width=\"1000\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c43ce629-dcaa-427e-8955-91661882821f\">\n\n*Service is suspended between Station 3 and Station 5. Service is available from Station 3 toward Station 1 and vice versa, and service is available from Station 5 toward Station 7 and vice versa.*\n\nIf service normally runs in both directions between Stations 1 and 7, but there is a suspension between Stations 3 and 5, the most logical available `effect` values are `NO_SERVICE` or `REDUCED_SERVICE`, where the `informed_entities` are Stations 3, 4, and 5. However, both of these `effects` leave uncertainty around what riders can or cannot do at Stations 3 and 5:\n\n- With an `effect` of `NO_SERVICE`, it would be reasonable for consumers to interpret that there is no service available in any direction at Station 3 or at Station 5, when in fact there is service between Stations 1 and 3 and there is service between Stations 5 and 7.\n- With an `effect` of `REDUCED_SERVICE`, it would be reasonable for consumers to interpret that some service is still available between Stations 3 and 5, when in fact no service is available.\n\n### Case 2. Bypassed stops\n\n<img width=\"1000\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11c3752e-1462-4587-843d-4a26214d66b2\">\n\n*Stations 3, 4, and 5 are temporarily closed. Riders cannot board or exit at these stations, but passenger trains can ride through them.*\n\nIf specific stations\u2019 entrances and exits are closed due to police activity, and riders can ride through those stations but not board or exit there, there is no way to convey this unambiguously through the existing alert spec.\n\n- With an `effect` of `NO_SERVICE`, it would be reasonable for consumers to interpret that there is no service available at all at those stations, when in fact there is service moving through those stations.\n- With an `effect` of `REDUCED_SERVICE`, it is not possible for consumers to know in what way service is reduced, i.e. riders cannot board or exit at the affected stations.\n\n## Real-world example: Rail suspension with `effect` of `NO_SERVICE`\n\nA suspension with an effect of `NO_SERVICE` appears in third-party applications as unavailable service between the affected stations. The limit stations of the suspension appear as having no service at all, even to and from adjacent, unaffected stations. This implies to riders that they must find another way to the limit stations from adjacent, unaffected stations, when in fact they can take normal rail service between those stations.\n\n### Google Maps\n\n- Suspension limits: North Station to Kenmore (MBTA in Boston, MA)\n- At North Station, northbound trips (away from the suspension) are shown as cancelled and predictions are not available, despite these trips being possible and predictions being available.\n\n<img width=\"250\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7c8939f-42a8-4d7f-8bdf-ba7e17e08532\" />\n\n### Apple Maps\n\n- Suspension limits: Back Bay to Roxbury Crossing (MBTA in Boston, MA)\n- Service between Jackson Square (not part of the suspension) and Roxbury Crossing (a limit station of the suspension) is shown as unavailable, despite it being available.\n\n<img width=\"500\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/677e9b7e-eda1-46a2-a182-7134f67bbbba\" />\n\n### Transit App\n\n- Suspension limits: North Station to Jackson Square (MBTA in Boston, MA)\n- Service between Jackson Square (a limit station of the suspension) and Stony Brook (not part of the suspension) is shown as unavailable, despite it being available.\n- Service between North Station (a limit station of the suspension) and Community College (not part of the suspension) is shown as unavailable, despite it being available.\n\n<img width=\"250\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/438ab801-2cd2-43f7-a6e3-b1461c87e21d\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img width=\"250\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60cbc9a5-fd59-482e-b500-018be6102ba4\"/> \n\n## Real-world example: Rail suspension with `effect` of `REDUCED_SERVICE`\n\nA suspension with an effect of `REDUCED_SERVICE` appears in some third-party applications as seemingly normal service, with an unassuming alert that reads \u201cReduced service\u201d, and details (upon tapping) that describe the limits of the suspension, specifying that service is actually unavailable.\n\n### **Google Maps**\n\n<img width=\"250\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f84394be-2ad7-40ba-8c49-83aebbe4866d\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img width=\"250\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/598bfe4d-8380-4865-89f5-457ffa23a720\" />\n\n### **Apple Maps**\n\n<img width=\"250\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0806bef1-ead7-40d1-b4c8-5d2efd00485c\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img width=\"250\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b5c9bff-85ca-4767-8750-8f146b61a72b\" />\n\n### Transit App\n\n<img width=\"250\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54836c8d-472b-4391-b033-d20f9276ef6c\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img width=\"250\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8b0946b-b60a-403f-ad00-c43a8eb61bb8\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img width=\"250\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87261e96-3773-4f3e-a59d-f542151706cc\" />\n\n## Counter-perspectives\n\n### Only create `informed_entities` for the stations with absolutely no service\n\nAn argument could be made that in Case 1 above, only Station 4\u2019s stops should be listed in `informed_entities`, and Station 3 and Station 5\u2019s stops should not be in `informed_entities` at all, because Stations 3 and 5 do have some service.\n\nWe don\u2019t believe this solution provides consumers with sufficient information to be helpful to riders. A single `informed_entity` at Station 4 could be reasonably interpreted as either a suspension of service between Station 3 and Station 5 or a simple bypass of Station 4 with full service at Stations 3 and 5. Additionally, if Stations 3 and 5\u2019s stops are not `informed_entities`, providing stop-specific information for those stations describing what service is available would not be possible.\n\nPerhaps more material, if service were suspended between only Station 3 and Station 4, it is unclear how that suspension could be conveyed to consumers at all using this paradigm.\n\n<img width=\"250\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f6bd578-104e-4984-99e3-427663de5968\" />\n\n*Transit App: A suspension between\nPark Street and Government Center,\nwith `informed_entities` at both, is\npresented as a station bypass*\n\n### Create multiple alerts for one service disruption\n\nAn argument could be made that in Case 1 above, there should be multiple service alerts: one with an `effect` of `NO_SERVICE` to describe the complete lack of service at Station 4, and one or two with an `effect` of `REDUCED_SERVICE` to describe the reduced service at Stations 3 and 5.\n\nHowever, creating multiple alerts for one service disruption has multiple drawbacks:\n\n- This implies that there is more than one disruption occurring when there is not. A full list of alerts along a route might include multiple alerts for a single disruption, leading to undue confusion and concern about how disrupted the route truly is.\n- An `effect` of `REDUCED_SERVICE` at Stations 3 and 5 still provides no insight into what riders can and cannot do at those stations, and in what directions they can travel to or from those stations.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nWe propose the addition of a new `activities` field within `informed_entity` in the GTFS Realtime Alert spec. This field would have enumerated values of `BOARD`, `EXIT`, and `RIDE`, which describe the rider activities that are *unavailable* at a given `stop`.\n\n## Case 1 solution\n\nIf we take the suspension scenario above, we can assign affected activities to each `stop` within each of the stations where service is affected by the suspension:\n\n- Stop 3-7: `[\"BOARD\", \"RIDE\"]`\n- Stop 3-1: `[\"EXIT\", \"RIDE\"]`\n- Stop 4-7: `[\"BOARD\", \"EXIT\", \"RIDE\"]`\n- Stop 4-1: `[\"BOARD\", \"EXIT\", \"RIDE\"]`\n- Stop 5-7: `[\"EXIT\", \"RIDE\"]`\n- Stop 5-1: `[\"BOARD\", \"RIDE\"]`\n\n<img

partnership with our alerts tooling vendor Arcadis (@dan-engler-arcadis), has been using `activities` in `informed_entities` in our enhanced GTFS feed in our production environment for several years, and it has been integral in enabling internal tools to solve the problems described above. We are excited by the prospect of third-party applications being able to present the same kind of nuances in service disruptions.\n\nThe MBTA and Arcadis have also extended `activities` to satisfy other use cases. Beyond `BOARD`, `EXIT`, and `RIDE`, we use `activities` to describe access-related activities that are affected by an alert. For example:\n\n- An alert about elevator maintenance that would disrupt wheelchair use while boarding or exiting would include\u00a0`USING_WHEELCHAIR` in its\u00a0`activities`.\n\nArcadis\u2019s\u00a0[TRANSIT-alerts GTFS-realtime documentation](https://transit-alerts-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/IBI_TRANSIT-alerts_GTFS-realtime_Documentation.pdf)\u00a0section on activities (pages 15-16) includes specifics about the other alert activities related to facilities, namely `USING_WHEELCHAIR`,\u00a0`USING_ESCALATOR`,\u00a0`BRINGING_BIKE`,\u00a0`STORE_BIKE`, and\u00a0`PARK_CAR`, and the hierarchical nature of activities.\n\nExamples of activities can be found in our live enhanced GTFS feed here: https://cdn.mbta.com/realtime/Alerts_enhanced.json. Documentation of the feed can be found [here](https://github.com/mbta/gtfs-documentation/blob/master/reference/gtfs-realtime.md#enhanced-json-feeds).",

    "body": "## Summary\r\nThis proposal adds a new optional field, called `trip_route_type`, into `trips.txt`. It is currently in use by [MBTA](https://github.com/mbta/gtfs-documentation/blob/master/reference/gtfs.md#tripstxt) to denote trips inside a route where the type of transportation is not the same as the route itself.\r\n\r\n## Describe the Problem\r\nIt is impossible, in the current GTFS standard, to denote a trip using a different type of transportation within a route, where NeTEx can describe it well by assigning a mode of transport at the trip level. For example, it is possible in NeTEx, but not GTFS, to denote a bus trip running on a tram route.\r\n\r\n## Use Cases\r\nIf a rail replacement bus is associated as to a rail route, it can then be shown when querying the trips of the route such that travellers are aware of it. For example, in Stockholm, bus departures can be occasionally found on route 7, which is advertised as a tram route, intervened between tram departures.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be used when the rail replacement bus has a separate identity to the rail route (for example, in the London Underground, the replacement buses have separate codes, such as ML-1 when the tube line is closed, in this case they should be modelled as a separate route using the existing method)\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\nAdd a field `trip_route_type` into `trips.txt` which specifies the type of transportation for the particular trip.\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\n<!--Please select the relevant change type.--> \r\n\r\nGTFS Schedule\r\n- [x] Functional Change\r\n- [ ] Non-Functional Change\r\n- [ ] Documentation Maintenance\r\n\r\nGTFS Realtime\r\n- [ ] Specification Change\r\n- [ ] Specification Change (Experimental Field)\r\n\r\n## Additional Information\r\nOpenTripPlanner is now [facing difficulty in achieving a standard-neutral treatment](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/6676#issuecomment-3018113097) of rail replacement buses because of the inability in GTFS to specify the same concept in NeTEx.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Discussion Period\r\nThis is a small, non-breaking change, so 10 days should be enough for discussion.\r\n\r\n## Testing Details\r\n<!--If applicable, confirm the identity of the Consumer(s) and Producer(s) who will test the changes in the Pull Request comment section and document them below.-->\r\n\r\n- Consumer(s): OpenTripPlanner (to be confirmed)\r\n- Producer(s): MBTA\r\n- Estimated Testing Period: 14 days\r\n\r\n## Proposal Update Tracker \r\n<!--Track changes to this Pull Request post over time, including edits and updates to the proposal.

Our long-term goal is to build a strong foundation for future updates, including the possible unification of GTFS Schedule and Realtime governances.\n\n## Transition Period\n- As of July 7, 2025, all new Pull Requests are subject to the new [GTFS Schedule Governance Framework](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/Governance/introduction.md).\n- Pull Requests opened before July 7, 2025 will continue to follow the [Former Governance](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/Governance/CHANGES.md).\n  - This includes the following PRs: https://github.com/google/transit/pull/567, https://github.com/google/transit/pull/561, https://github.com/google/transit/pull/556, https://github.com/google/transit/pull/546, https://github.com/google/transit/pull/545, https://github.com/google/transit/pull/533, https://github.com/google/transit/pull/515, https://github.com/google/transit/pull/502, https://github.com/google/transit/pull/498, https://github.com/google/transit/pull/483, https://github.com/google/transit/pull/423.\n  - These PRs have also been attributed the label of: `Former Governance Applies`\n- Once all PRs opened prior to July 7, 2025 are resolved, the [Former Governance](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/Governance/CHANGES.md) will be fully deprecated.\n\n## Revision Period\n- The new GTFS Schedule Governance Framework is undergoing a 6-month revision period, so that the community can help fine tune it. \n-  We ask the community to use the comment section below to submit noticed frictions or issues they noticed when using the governance. This will allow us to collect valuable feedback and work collectively on an improvement. \n- At the end of this period, we will communicate next steps here and / or host a meeting to assess the current state by identifying areas of improvement and their potential solutions. \n\n## Ideas with considerable discussion and / or support\n\n- #442 \n- #495 \n- #415 \n- #530 \n- Merging GTFS Schedule and GTFS Realtime Governances\n\n## Ideas to be discussed\n\n- Revising the Guiding Principals \n- Experimental phase for proposals based on adoption\n- Flexibility in 1 Consumer and 1 Producers testing requirements and depreciation of \u201csmall\u201d unused fields\n- Formalizing Working Groups \n- Versioning and backward compatibility\n- MDIP Certification / badging for contributors\n- Deprecating Google Groups Requirement \n\nPlease feel free to submit any ideas you feel could improve the governance of GTFS. We will be sure to add them to this list. \n",

I attached a screenshot showing the situation. This is a bad user experience, of course, since it's not clear which headsign is correct or which time is correct.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a183c02-f180-4dc9-8ff6-475e218aad73)\n\nI first describe the technical issue and then mention two possible ways to improve the situation.\n\nTechnical issue:\nThe feed uses block_id for vehicles, both at end stations and at a significant transit station where they have trips starting and ending but to some passengers is just an intermediate stop.\n\nThe arrival_time and departure_time for the last stop of trip A do not match the arrival_time and departure_time for the first stop of trip B.\n\nExample: Vehicle arrives at 9:00 and departs at 9:02.\nFeed shows:\ntrip A and trip B in the same block\ntrip A final stop: stop alpha, arrive 9:00, depart 9:00\ntrip B first stop: stop alpha, arrive 9:02, depart 9:02\n\nSince arrival_time and departure_time are both required, even at starting and ending stops, the feed uses the recommended approach of using the same time for both. But this creates contradictory data.\n\nTransit App shows a departure at 9:00 using the headsign for trip A and a departure at 9:02 using the headsign for trip B.\n\nIdeas to improve the situation; either one or both would help, I think:\n\n* Require that arrival_time and departure_time both match (or are omitted, if the second suggestion is adopted) for trips connected by a block_id. We can add a check in the validator tool to help feeds avoid the inconsistent data.\n\n* Do not require a departure_time on the final stop of a trip or an arrival time for the first stop of a trip. Encourage feeds to omit these times unless they are meaningful. Why are they required when they are generally meaningless?\n",

Validators would check that feeds using distance measurements in shapes.txt, stop_times.txt, or fare_legs.txt have a specified unit.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAn optional field in feed_info.txt or agency.txt would be a good place to house a distance_unit field, possibly with constrained options for useable unit types. With the distance requirements of fares_v2 it may eventually need to be a required field.\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

Additionally, GTFS-Pathways has a number of allowances for this sort of functionality, but the current operational state of them doesn't seem to be reflected in GTFS-Realtime.\n \nWould there be a possibility of expanding GTFS-Realtime to additional types of accessibility beyond just wheelchairs? For example, indicating that a stop has an escalator (and a corresponding GTFS-Realtime field for its current status) could be useful to parents with a stroller, or someone for whom stairs might not be accessible but an escalator would, and they could choose a different route/stop if that service was out of order.",

Examples of non-passenger stops include driver change points at service motorways, technical stops for refuelling, passing points on single-track railways, etc. where the service must stop.\n\nI am seeing some GTFS generator / dataset putting some internal \"pass points\", which serves as timing points (and possibly validates tickets) but the service doesn't stop at all, into the `stop_times.txt` which has resulted in our frontend applications giving misleading instructions (showing them in the stop list).\n\nI would like a clarification on the above matter. \n\nIs it appropriate to put places, where a service passes through but do not actually stop, into `stop_times.txt`? Some of these places are relevant to passengers because they validate certain tickets.",

Add `fare_units_traveled` in `stop_times.txt`\r\n2. Add fields for matching `min_distance`, `max_distance` and `distance_type` in `fare_leg_rules.txt`\r\n3. Adjust `fare_leg_join_rules.txt` to cover distance-based legs and include `duration_limit` and `duration_limit_type` (similar to `fare_transfer_rules.txt`) to limit the fare leg within a time window.\r\n4.

However, the mechanism was still insufficient to fully model the fare structure. Therefore, we simplified the PR to be able to model most fares around the world using `fare_leg_rules.txt` and `fare_leg_join_rules.txt`.\r\n",

    "body": "### Introduce yourself\n\n_No response_\n\n### Ask a question\n\nFrom my understanding of the modelling in GTFS Fares v2,\n\n1. Physical legs are joined into effective fare legs using `fare_leg_join_rules.txt`\n2. Each fare leg is matched with the applicable fares. If multiple fare legs match a rule in `fare_transfer_rules.txt`, the transfer is processed.\n\nIn the PAYG rail network in London, in general fares are defined on a station-to-station basis, and the fare system does not care how you transfer within the network within stations.\n\nThat means the above fact can be modelled by defining a rule for `fare_leg_join_rules.txt` that all legs in the PAYG route network should always be joined, by setting `from_network_id` to be the PAYG network, `to_network_id` to be the PAYG network (the default is that the legs joined must be at the same station - we can add rules for the likes of Hackney Central / Hackney Wick, or Bank / Monument where they are within the same gateline).\n\nHowever, there are also some situations where how you transfer will affect the fare. These are divided into two categories:\n\n1. Changing between two different stations (an OSI) where you *must* validate your fare media. This may increase or decrease your fare.\n2. Changing within the same station, where you *may* validate your fare media to decrease the fare.\nBoth of the above actions may or may not change your fare. So I am thinking about using `fare_transfer_rules.txt` to model them, but it now becomes extremely difficult:\n\nFor the case OSI between Underground and National Rail at a London Terminal, for an A-B1/B2-C journey where B1 is the National Rail station and B2 is the corresponding Underground station, if I model it using `fare_transfer_rules.txt`, it will require defining nearly a million rules (as there are approximately a thousand stations in the whole network) for every pair of A-C, to specify that two effective fare legs of A-B1 and B2-C with a transfer at B1/B2, which may resolve to a normal A-C fare, or some other fares. Multiply it with about a hundred OSIs in the network, it will soon become unmanageable. Moreover, if there are multiple such OSIs joined together, for example, an A-B1/B2-C1/C2-D1/D2-E journey to resolve to a certain A-E fare (which, in the fare collection system, is defined by the existence of a certain transfer within the sequence), I don't even know how I can model it in `fare_transfer_rules.txt`, because the only \"rule\" which does not take the individual leg fare into account is `fare_transfer_type` = 2, and in this case it will result in a A-C1 (transferring at B1/B2) + B2-D1 (transferring at C1/C2) + C2-E (transferring at D1/D2) fares as the total. There can be unlimited number of such consecutive OSIs in the network.\n\nBefore of the above nature and the fact that such joining is treated as a single fare leg in the fare collection system, it should really be modelled by `fare_leg_join_rules.txt` so the whole journey can be matched to one fare. However, it is impossible to match a fare product to a fare leg with the requirement that there must be a \"physical\" transfer within the \"effective fare leg\" (this is how the fares are technically implemented in the fare collection system). Moreover, we also need a way to exclude fares from changing at these specified places as well.\n\nIn the \"changing within the same station\" example, the same problem also exists. You can't obtain a certain fare just by passing through the station. You must get off and make a transfer at that station to validate for a certain fare, but the system doesn't care about how many other transfers you make within the network, and treats your journey as a single leg.\n\nCan anyone guide me if the above is possible in GTFS-v2?",

However, is it possible to split a physical leg to multiple fare legs, such that I can apply multiple fare products into a physical leg? (This is commonly known as \"split ticketing\" in Great Britain)\n\nIn addition, in GTFS Fares-v2, how can I define where the fare can be bought / validated? This is also needed to process split ticketing correctly as fares requiring validation at a station outside a vehicle cannot be used when splitting a physical leg into multiple fare legs.",

The last arrival time of from_trip_id MAY be later than the first departure time of to_trip_id in case the to_trip_id trip is occurring the subsequent service day.\n\nHowever, this modelling does not allow the specification where carriages are attached / detached in the middle of a trip, which is common in the National Rail network.\n\n### Use cases\n\nI would like to model the joining / splitting of train services, where carriages are attached / detached not at the end / beginning of a trip, but instead, in the middle of a trip.\n\nFor example, a train trip runs from London Bridge to Caterham, and another trip runs from Purley to Tattenham Corner by detaching a portion from the London Bridge to Caterham trip.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nRelax the requirement of `transfer_type = 4` to allow the transfer taking place between two trips, where the transfer stop is a terminus (start stop / end stop) for one of the trip, and any (including start / end / intermediate) stop for the other.\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes adding a `cars_allowed` field to `trips.txt`. There was a lot of discussion in issue https://github.com/google/transit/issues/466 about how to add car information for ferries to GTFS. The discussion was centered around whether to use an approach with `stop_times.txt` or `trips.txt`. A recent PR https://github.com/google/transit/pull/533 related to the topic generated discussion about `bikes_allowed`.\r\n\r\nBecause Digitransit will soon use the `cars_allowed` field in production through OTP and because of the discussion in https://github.com/google/transit/pull/533, I thought that it would be a good idea to create this proposal. It would be interesting to see if there is interest in this.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nFerries can have the possibility to have cars on board. For these ferries a field indicating whether cars are allowed would be useful.\r\nIn addition to car ferries, this can also apply to, for example, trains that can transport cars in a similar way.\r\n\r\n### Use cases\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n* To be able to distinguish car ferries.\r\n* To be able to distinguish trains with car transportation capabilities.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThe trips.txt GTFS file (https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#tripstxt) contains the field `bikes_allowed`\r\nwhich specifies whether bikes are allowed on board. For car ferries a similar field indicating whether cars are allowed should be added:\r\n\r\n`cars_allowed` - Enum - Optional\r\nIndicates whether cars are allowed. Valid options are:\r\n\r\n`0` or empty - No car information for the trip.\r\n`1` - Vehicle being used on this particular trip can accommodate at least one car.\r\n`2` - No cars are allowed on this trip.\n\n---\n- To see the specific tasks where the Asana app for GitHub is being used, see below:\n  - https://app.asana.com/0/0/1210563235088114",

    "body": "## Summary\r\nThis proposal introduces a new  `cemv_support` field in `agency.txt` and `routes.txt` to indicate if riders can use cEMV (contactless Europay, Mastercard, and Visa) to access a transit service under a specific agency or route. Its use is independent of all other fare files and can be used separately.\r\n\r\n## Describe the Problem\r\nThe current implementation of GTFS Fare features is intended to display the correct price for a given trip included in the feed. Through the use of the fare_media.txt file transit agencies can specify their support for contactless payment methods also known as cEMV (contactless Europay, Mastercard and Visa).\r\n\r\nHowever, to enable consumers to display the correct payment options for specific trips, fare rules must be fully defined. \r\nThere is currently no simple solution for producers who simply want to indicate that a contactless payment method is accepted for users to access a service.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\nThis proposal introduces a new, optional `cemv_support` field in two existing and widely used files: `agency.txt` and `routes.txt`. \r\n\r\nThis new field is proposed as an Enum field type with the following options:\r\n\r\n- **0 or empty**: No cEMV information available for trips associated with this agency or route \r\n- **1**: Riders may use cEMVs as fare media for trips associated with this agency or route \r\n- **2**: cEMVs are not supported as fare media for trips associated with this agency or route \r\n\r\nThis allows producers to clearly indicate cEMV support at the agency and route levels without requiring a full definition of their fare system rules. In turn, this enables trip planners to inform users that contactless payment methods can be used for their trip without detailing the trip's exact price.\r\n\r\nThe use of this field is intended to be independent of all other fare files and can be used separately. If both `agency.cemv_support` and `routes.cemv_support` are provided for the same service, `routes.cemv_support` takes precedence.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to note that in this proposal, cEMV support specifically refers to its use as fare media to pay a transit fare. It does not cover using cEMV to purchase fare products or add value to other fare media (e.g., buying a paper ticket or loading credit onto a transit card).\r\n\r\n## Use Cases\r\nOttawa's OC Transpo [allows users to pay](https://www.octranspo.com/en/fares/payment/o-payment/#:~:text=Tap%20and%20ride%20with%20O,green%20and%20show%20%22Accepted%22.) a regular adult fare by tapping with debit cards, credit cards and mobile wallets at fare readers on buses and fare gates at O-Train stations. Under the current GTFS Fares features, OC Transpo would need to define full fare rules to indicate cEMV support. \r\n\r\nBy using the new `cemv_support` field in `agency.txt` or `routes.txt`, OC Transpo could easily indicate that cEMV payments are accepted across its services without requiring a full fare model. \r\n\r\n## Additional Information\r\nWe recommend a minimum discussion period of 2 weeks for this proposal. Previous discussions took place in the January and February 2025 Fares Working Group meetings, where alternative approaches were considered before settling on the current one. Review the [working group meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d3g5bMXupdElCKrdv6rhFNN11mrQgEk-ibA7wdqVLTU/edit?usp=sharing) and the [original proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fcr4ETtEbAbPoot_a24xUf7xijVx0Bn-GP7Y-hodY8w/edit?usp=sharing) for further reference.

    "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\n**We\u2019re proposing an update to the current [GTFS governance process](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/CHANGES.md)** **based on two years of community feedback.** Key improvements include clearer documentation, structured proposal phases, and revised voting requirements. Now, we\u2019re inviting final discussions before calling a vote to adopt these changes.\r\n\r\n## \ud83c\udf0d Context\r\n\r\nGovernance has been a long-standing topic of discussion within the community. Over the past two years, MobilityData has gathered input through various consultations:\r\n\r\n* **Historical Feedback**: Community feedback highlighted the need for a more predictable and transparent governance process.  \r\n* **2023 Workshops**: Regional workshops in Valencia, Spain, and NYC, USA, provided targeted insights that shaped this proposal.  \r\n* **2024 Working Group Meetings**: Consensus was reached on several key governance improvements.\r\n\r\nSee Issue [#436](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/436) and [#413](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/413) for further details.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve incorporated these discussions into a structured proposal and now seek targeted community feedback before finalizing the vote.\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udd27 Key Changes\r\n\r\n* **New Document Structure**:  \r\n  * New **[Introduction section](https://github.com/MobilityData/transit/blob/20250312-New-Governance-proposal/gtfs/Governance/introduction.md)**  \r\n  * Clearer **[Roles & Responsibilities](https://github.com/MobilityData/transit/blob/20250312-New-Governance-proposal/gtfs/Governance/roles.md)** (Producers, Consumers, Contributors, Maintainer, Advocate & First Adopters)  \r\n  * Defined [**Change Types**](https://github.com/MobilityData/transit/blob/20250312-New-Governance-proposal/gtfs/Governance/change-types.md) (Functional, Non-functional, Documentation maintenance)  \r\n  * [**Guiding Principles**](https://github.com/MobilityData/transit/blob/20250312-New-Governance-proposal/gtfs/Governance/guiding-principles.md) separated from the Change Process, with content unchanged  \r\n* **More Detailed [Change Process](https://github.com/MobilityData/transit/blob/20250312-New-Governance-proposal/gtfs/Governance/change-process.md)**:  \r\n  * Step-by-step guidance with visual aids  \r\n  * Formalized **Issue Phase** before Pull Request submission  \r\n  * Increased voting requirements  \r\n  * **New second voting phase** requiring an 80% majority  \r\n  * Introduced Pull Request Template ([see example here](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/543))\r\n\r\n## \u23ed\ufe0f Next Steps\r\n\r\nWe invite the community to review the proposed next steps and share feedback to ensure all perspectives are considered and no key aspects are overlooked. Your input is essential to ensuring the new governance framework reflects the needs of the community.\r\n\r\n* MobilityData asks the community to begin discussing the proposal and review the changes before calling a vote.   \r\n  * We want to reserve **at least a month for discussion** to give everyone a chance to discuss and review the changes.  \r\n  * If after a month outstanding questions/comments remain, we will extend the discussion period as needed.  \r\n  * After soft consensus is reached and all items are resolved, we\u2019ll call a vote **based on the current Specification change process.**  \r\n* If the new governance is adopted:  \r\n  * MobilityData proposes the following Adjustment Period:  \r\n    * All new PRs opened **before** adoption (successful vote) of the new governance will be subject to the current governance rules.  \r\n    * All PRs opened **after** adoption (successful vote) of the new governance will be subject to the new governance rules.  \r\n  * MobilityData proposes to open an issue and/or host a meeting six months after adoption to gather feedback and evaluate how the proposal has been working in practice, determining if a revision is needed.\r\n\r\nLet us know your thoughts! \ud83d\ude80",

    "body": "THIS IS MEANT TO SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE FOR A PR TEMPLATE\n\n## Summary \nThis proposal introduces a new **\"rider category eligibility\" field** to GTFS-Fares v2, allowing agencies to specify eligibility criteria for discounted or restricted fare categories (e.g., senior, student, low-income). This change improves clarity for both data producers and consumers, ensuring accurate fare application across transit systems.  \n\n## Describe the Problem  \nCurrently, GTFS-Fares v2 allows defining fare products and their pricing but lacks a standardized way to indicate **who qualifies for certain fares**. This leads to inconsistent implementations, requiring agencies and consumers to rely on non-standard methods like external documentation or assumptions.  \n\nRelevant issue: [google/transit#XYZ](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/XYZ)  \n\n## Use Cases  \n- **Student Discount:** A university transit pass is available only to students with a valid ID.  \n- **Low-Income Fare Program:** A city offers reduced fares for riders enrolled in a government assistance program.  \n- **Senior Fare:** Riders aged 65+ receive a discount but must verify their age.  \n\nWith this proposal, transit apps can accurately **display and enforce** eligibility rules, preventing confusion and ensuring correct fare application.  \n\n**Example:**  \nA transit rider views a discounted fare in an app, but instead of uncertainty, they now see **\"Available for registered students only. Apply via agency website.\"**  \n\n## Proposed Solution  \nAdd a new field to `fare_leg_rules.txt` and `fare_transfer_rules.txt`:  \n\n| Field Name | Type | Required | Description |  \n|------------|------|----------|-------------|  \n| `rider_category_id` | ID | Optional | References a new `rider_categories.txt` file defining eligibility criteria for certain fares. |  \n\nIntroduce `rider_categories.txt`:  \n\n| Field Name | Type | Required | Description |  \n|------------|------|----------|-------------|  \n| `rider_category_id` | ID | Required | Unique identifier for the rider category. |  \n| `name` | Text | Required | Human-readable name (e.g., \"Senior\", \"Student\", \"Low Income\"). |  \n| `eligibility_description` | Text | Optional | Description of eligibility criteria. |  \n\n## Type of Change  \nGTFS Schedule \n- [x] Functional Change  \n- [ ] Non-Functional Change  \n- [ ] Documentation Maintenance  \n\nGTFS Realtime  \n- [ ] Specification Change  \n- [ ] Specification Change (Experimental Field)  \n\n## Additional Information  \n- Discussion in GTFS Slack: [#fares-v2](https://gtfs.slack.com/archives/XXXXXX)  \n- Related proposals: [GTFS-Fares v2 adoption discussion](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/ABC)  \n- Some agencies (e.g., MBTA, LA Metro) have expressed interest in standardizing eligibility representation.  \n\n## Proposed Discussion Period  \nI recommend a **minimum discussion period of 4 weeks** to allow agencies, transit apps, and other stakeholders to provide input on the proposed changes.  \n\n## Testing Details  \n- **Consumers:** Transit, Google Maps, Moovit \n- **Producers:** MBTA, LA Metro  \n- **Estimated Testing Period:** 6-8 weeks  \n\n## Proposal Update Tracker  \n\n| Date       | Update Description |  \n|------------|--------------------|  \n| 2025-03-11 | Initial draft proposal submitted for discussion. |\n| 2025-03-11 | Edited Testing details|   \n\n## Checklist  \n- [x] I have read and understood the [GTFS Change process](https://github.com/google/transit/tree/master/gtfs/Governance/change-process.md).\n- [x] I have read and understood the [GTFS Guiding Principles](https://github.com/google/transit/tree/master/gtfs/Governance/guiding-principles.md). \n- [x] I understand the [Role of Advocate and the Responsibilities](https://github.com/google/transit/tree/master/gtfs/Governance/roles.md) attached to it. \n- [x] I have signed the [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual).\n- [x] I have ensured that this proposal is not covered by an existing Pull Request.\n",

Now, if we want to define a universally available free transfer, is it necessary to duplicate `fare_transfer_rules` and `fare_products` for each type of `fare_media`, or is it valid to use a null `fare_media_id` to indicate compatibility with all fare products?\n\nIn other words, does a null value for `fare_media_id` act as a wildcard, applying to any fare medium, or is it considered non compatible with other fare medium, requiring an explicit enumeration of transfer rules for each fare medium via fare_products?",

    "body": "This pull request is related to issue https://github.com/google/transit/issues/462\r\n\r\n**Context:** In Switzerland we've introduced the Swiss Journey ID (documentation only in DE/FR/IT: https://www.oev-info.ch/de/datenmanagement/sid4pt-swiss-id-public-transport/swiss-journey-identification-sjyid).\r\nThis ID is valid for one operating day and across different days of a scheduled year. It therefore maps to one or more trip_ids.\r\n\r\n**Proposal:** Based on the suggestion by @miklcct (in the referenced issue) we propose to use the original_trip_id (as defined in https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference?hl=en) in GTFS Schedule and GTFS Realtime to represent constructs such as our SJYID. With this it is possible to combine trips from GTFS Schedule and GTFS Realtime with other standards such as SIRI or NeTEx, which have a similar concept. \r\n\r\n**Implementation:** Since the 12.12.2024 we offer the original_trip_id (filled with our SJYID) as part of GTFS Schedule (doc: https://opentransportdata.swiss/en/cookbook/gtfs/#tripstxt) and GTFS Realtime (doc: https://opentransportdata.swiss/en/cookbook/gtfs-rt/#Trip_updates). In one case our consumers use the original_trip_id in GTFS Realtime to match with timetable data in the (proprietary) HRDF format.\r\n\r\n**Generalizability:** Based on early discussions with other public transport providers, we think this enhancement can benefit many other producers and consumers and increase the inter-operability of GTFS with other standards. \r\n",

    "body": "Previous discussion: #466 \r\n\r\nThe current GTFS specification cannot express if a bike can only be carried on part of the trip, or if it cannot be boarded or alighted at certain stops even if it can be carried on the trip.\r\n\r\nThis proposal provides a generic solution to specify if any kinds of vehicles can be carried, boarded or alighted on any public transport service at a per-stop granularity, by introducing a new file `boarding_permissions.txt`, which is referenced from `stop_times.txt`. The introduction of this new feature does not break any existing compatibility.\r\n\r\n## Use case: Bikes allowed only on certain part of trip at certain times\r\nLondon Underground allows the carriage of bikes, but only outside peak hours and outside the deep tube sections. With this proposal, it is possible to assign stop times to either accept bikes outside peak hours (for stops outside the deep tube sections), or to not accept bikes at all (for stops inside the deep tube sections).\r\n\r\n## Use case: Mandatory bike reservation\r\nOn some long distance trains, a bike space must be reserved by the passenger in order for a bike to be carried. By assigning the stop times for the whole trip to a boarding permission which requires bike reservation, the journey planner can tell the passenger that a bike space must be reserved.\r\n\r\n## Use case: Staff assistance required for wheelchair boarding\r\nOn some National Rail journeys, wheelchair can board trains unassisted at some stations, but assistance is required at other stations. By assigning the stop times to appropriate boarding permissions, accurate instructions can be given to the user if assistance needs to be arranged.\r\n\r\n## Use case: Service which requires the carriage of vehicle\r\nThe Silvertown tunnel bike shuttle requires passengers to carry a bike to use the service. By setting `pickup_type` and `drop_off_type` = 1 in `stop_times.txt` and assigning positive bike boarding permission for the stop times, consumers which understand this proposal can route bike passengers onto the shuttle, while the service won't be suggested by legacy consumers which don't understand bikes.",

For example, should it allow for the complete removal of certain elements or the redefinition (modification) of content from previous versions in the new version spec?\n- Compared to the existing mechanism of using the [deprecated = true] tag, what are the advantages and potential risks of implementing versioning?",

Set a negative (fake) trip_id to a specific trip inside TripDescriptor.  This negative (fake) trip_id is not found inside GTFS-Static but is provided for backwards compatibility for older data consumers which assume a trip_id exists.\n\n2. Instead of providing a fake trip_id, it will be omitted.   We assume a fake trip_id is not necessary for modern GTFS-RT data consumers.\n\nNote that alongside the route_id, direction_id, start_time and start_date will be set.

There are two trains scheduled to leave the football stadium, both 30 minutes and 60 minutes after the game ends.\r\n\r\nIf the event ends early, the agency can accommodate passengers immediately, meaning that the first train can leave as early as 7:30 PM.\r\n\r\nDue to federal rest restrictions, the final train must leave by midnight, and the prior train must leave by 11:45 PM. The latest the game can end while supporting the scheduled service pattern would be 11:00 PM for the second train, and 11:15 PM for the first train.\r\n\r\nThe first scheduled departure trip has trip_id `trip_approx_1` and the second trip has ID `trip_approx_2`. Only passengers with a special event ticket are able to ride.\r\n\r\n**stop_times.txt**\r\n\r\n```csv\r\ntrip_id,arrival_time,departure_time,stop_id,stop_sequence,pickup_type,drop_off_type,timepoint\r\ntrip_approx_1,22:30:00,22:30:00,stadium,10,0,1,0\r\ntrip_approx_1,23:00:00,23:00:00,suburb,20,1,0,0\r\ntrip_approx_1,23:15:00,23:15:00,downtown,30,1,0,0\r\ntrip_approx_2,23:00:00,23:00:00,stadium,10,0,1,0\r\ntrip_approx_2,23:30:00,23:30:00,suburb,20,1,0,0\r\ntrip_approx_2,23:45:00,23:45:00,downtown,30,1,0,0\r\n```\r\n\r\n**event_based_trips.txt**\r\n\r\n```csv\r\ntrip_id,event_end_approximate,event_end_earliest,event_end_latest,event_fares\r\ntrip_approx_1,22:00:00,19:00:00,23:00:00,1\r\ntrip_approx_2,22:00:00,19:00:00,23:00:00,1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- `stop_times.txt` shows the **approximate** stop times for each trip, assuming that the event ends at its expected time.\r\n\t- By using `stop_times.txt` and the `event_end_earliest` and `event_end_latest` fields, one can determine the earliest and latest stop times for each trip.\r\n\t- Using the `event_end_apprximate` field, one can determine how long after the event each trip departs.\r\n- The `event_end_latest` field may not be the same between trips. For example, NJ Transit's River Line must do a short trip during late-night service due to track restrictions. Thus, a hypothetical event must have an earlier end time to support trips that cover the entire line.",

    "body": "### Describe the problem\n\nMany carriers operate special event service to stadiums and other event venues.\n\nThis special event service is sometimes the ONLY service available to the stadium, as is most common in the North American Rail Market during off-peak / weekend hours.\n\nWhile these special-event trips typically operate on a posted schedule en-route _to_ the event, **_return_ trips typically operate a less-precise service, departing \"x minutes following the conclusion of the event.\"**\n\nThis phenomenon is not something that can be modeled natively in GTFS, leading to three possible approaches:\n\n- Omit the trips entirely in the GTFS Schedule, hoping that customers assume there will be some return service based on the special-event service to the event, but risking confusion around the return.\n\n- Schedule the trips in the GTFS Schedule based on an approximate event end time, risking confusion that customers could need to depart prior to the conclusion of the event, or implying the operator should be held to an inflexible schedule.\n\n- Schedule the trips in the GTFS Schedule based on the latest possible end time, dissuading some customers from using the service based upon an artificially-lengthy journey time, or leaving customers to believe they could stay later than possible in the event of extended event durations.\n\nIn all cases, the partial lack of data leads to confusion for riders.\n\n### Use cases\n\n- Show customers in static information that return service is available from an event location, even when the specific departure time is variable.\n- Provide a mechanism for customers to know the latest possible time at which they must leave a special event, where applicable.\n- Avoid simply displaying the trip as a static scheduled interval, without the producer also providing detail surrounding the trip's variability.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n1. Trips should be scheduled in GTFS based upon the most-likely **departure** time, and standardized `stop_time` entries would be based upon the most-likely departure time.\n\n2. A new file `event_based_trips.txt` would serve to indicate to consumers and customers that applicable trips are post-event extras, operating based on an expected **event end** time.\n\nThis approach ensures backwards-compatibility in that consumers could still display an approximate trip time based upon the most likely time of operation without modification, while more robust consumers could contextualize the trip as a post-event service, detailing the service span, post-event departure duration, onward connections, etc.\n\nThis framework also supports a future basis on which an operator could define a specific event end time in real-time, and have predictions for each trip based upon offsets adjusted from the actual event end time.\n\n*N.B. Most North American consumers would NOT publish [1] without also being able to produce [2] to avoid indicating a precise departure time for the event without ALSO having a structured means to represent the special-event structure.*\n\n### Additional information\n\nThis scheduling practice is employed by:\n\n- **MBTA Commuter Rail (Boston, MA)** \u2014 Return trips from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough (for Football and Concerts) is typically provided by a single special-event train per destination that depart x minutes following the conclusion of the event. There is no other public transit to the stadium.\n\n- **NJ Transit RiverLINE (Camden, NJ)** \u2014 Return trips from the Waterfront Entertainment Center operate on a load-and-go basis following the conclusion of events, but only until 9pm Sunday through Friday; after that time, no matter how late the event runs, light rail service will only operate along a portion of the line.\n\n- **NJ Transit Rail (Meadowlands, NJ)** \u2014 Return trips from the Meadowlands have a published schedule that is released as a general guideline, but that is significantly modified on the day of the event to accommodate the actual event. The last return train is guaranteed to not leave before the stated time.\n\n- **MSP Metro-Transit's Northstar Line (Minneapolis, MN)** \u2014 Return trips from U.S. Bank Stadium depart the Target Field station x minutes following the conclusion of the event. There is no other public transit along this corridor on weekend event days.\n\n- **Metrolink (Los Angeles, CA)** \u2014 Return trips from Angel Stadium depart x minutes following the conclusion of the event. There are no other trips on one line besides the special-event service, and the other operates extremely limited service on weekend event days.\n\n- **MTA Long Island Rail Road (Long Island, NY)** \u2014 Return trips from various arens and events are provided x minutes following the conclusion of the event. These trips supplement existing services and relieve crowding on otherwise normal-ridership trains.\n\n- **Metra (Chicago, IL)** \u2014 Return trips from various stadiums depart x minutes following the conclusion of the event. One such supplemental trip is provided on certain lines to fill gaps and address post-event crowding.\n\n- **Coaster (San Diego, CA)** \u2014 Return trips from Petco Park depart x minutes following the conclusion of the event. This trip is typically the only service on the line, operating beyond the normal span of service, with a hard deadline departure time. A future service expansion will extend the line directly to the stadium only for games.\n\netc.\n",

They both wait at the first stop until they are full and then start on their route.\n\n### Use cases\n\nCases where there is no fixed schedule or frequency that is being followed.\n\n- Subway and rail shuttle bus replacements where buses depart when they are full, often with a wave of vehicles after train has arrived from the part of the line that is still open.\n- Popular transport where privately owned buses depart on their own time, usually when they have enough passengers.\n- Vehicles being run for a special event where there may be a wave of trips departing when the event ends.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nA new option for the `exact_times` enum in the frequencies.txt file which would indicate trips will depart based on the number of passengers at the first stop and other factors that may not be predictable and the headway is only average to indicate the overall level of service.\n\n### Additional information\n\nI'm not in a position to be the advocate for this change. I don't even use frequencies.txt in TransSee right now. It's just an idea that I thought should be shared.",

    "body": "### Describe the problem\n\nIn the GTFS Realtime Alert spec, `active_period` is defined as: _Time when the alert should be shown to the user. If missing, the alert will be shown as long as it appears in the feed. If multiple ranges are given, the alert will be shown during all of them_.\n\nHowever, there still is an ambiguity of interpretation of the `active_period` field; whether it is intended for the period of showing the alert or for the period of the related service disruption itself.\n\n\n### Use cases\n\nWe need to distinguish:\n\n1. The period when the alert is shown -> Communication period of the alert\n2. The period when the alert is actually in effect -> Impact period of the alert\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nWe propose the addition of two fields, `communication_period` and `impact_period`, to disambiguate `active_period`.\n\nThe detailed proposal is found here: [communication_period and impact_period proposal\n](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t5hMwqC0WXfgKzhkJFT_h0QwbtvqWzB4vFN1j7-ciXI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n### Additional information\n\nMore information regarding the extent of this issue can be found in [PR#482](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/482)",

    "body": "### Describe the problem\n\nMany GTFS feeds are published under licenses that might restrict certain aspects of re-use. The information for these license are often found on the agency websites and can be hard to find. This creates ambiguity for use cases of the GTFS, and might delay their ingestion in trip planners.\n\n### Use cases\n\nAdding license information to the GTFS spec allows consumers to easily figure out what they can use the GTFS for, whether they can modify it, re-share it, etc.\nFor consumers who work with hundreds of GTFS, the operation can even be automatized using the license information in the GTFS.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSolution 1) Adding fields to `feed_info.txt` since it can contain non-rider-facing information.\n\n`license_spdx_id`: The [SPDX ID](https://spdx.org/licenses/) of the GTFS feed license\n`license_name`: The name of the license\n`license_url`: linking to either the website of the license, to SPDX or to a page in the agency website that details the conditions of use of the GTFS.\n\nSolution 2) Adding a file called `license_info.txt` containing `license_spdx_id`, `license_name` and `license_url`.\n\nA drawback of this 2nd solution is that `license.txt` is a popular non-CSV file for software in general.\n\n\n\n### Additional information\n\n[GBFS has license information](https://gbfs.org/specification/reference/#system_informationjson). In v3, `license_url` and `license_id` (SPDX ID) are conditionally forbidden. That can be the case with GTFS by providing a `license_id` if it exists in the [SPDX license list](https://spdx.org/licenses/), otherwise prividing a `license_url`.",

    "body": "### Describe the problem\n\nCaltrans has recently completed a research project on holiday service data quality ([see paper](https://www.calitp.org/assets/Cal-ITP-2023-Holiday-Service-Transit-Traveler-Information-Research.pdf)). One of the findings of our research indicated a confusion among some agencies on the best ways to include holiday information within GTFS data.\n\nThe current GTFS Schedule specification narrative does not affirmatively say that holiday data _should_ be included. There are some places that list examples or suggest that holiday information _could_ be added as follows:\n\n[booking_rules.txt](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/#:~:text=weekdays%20without%20holidays):\n\n> Example: If empty, prior_notice_start_day=2 will be two calendar days in advance. If defined as a service_id containing only business days (weekdays without holidays), prior_notice_start_day=2 will be two business days in advance.\n\n[calendar_dates.txt](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/#:~:text=suppose%20a%20route%20has%20one%20set%20of%20trips%20available%20on%20holidays)\n\n> Example: Suppose a route has one set of trips available on holidays and another set of trips available on all other days. One service_id could correspond to the regular service schedule and another service_id could correspond to the holiday schedule. For a particular holiday, the [calendar_dates.txt](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/#calendar_datestxt) file could be used to add the holiday to the holiday service_id and to remove the holiday from the regular service_id schedule.\n\n[best practices on All Fields](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/schedule_best_practices/#:~:text=route%202%20includes%20a%20deviation%20on%20main%20street%20nights%2C%20sundays%2C%20and%20holidays.)\n\n> Route 2 includes a deviation on Main Street nights, Sundays, and holidays.\n\n### Use cases\n\nThis applies to major holidays regularly observed each year by transit agencies.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThis proposal seeks to clarify within the GTFS Specification narrative that holiday service known in advance and generally repeating each year should be an explicitly expected element of all GTFS Schedule feeds.\n\nA possible place to insert this expectation would be within the bullet points outlining expectations for current and upcoming service (bold indicates new addition):\n\n- _One GTFS dataset should contain current and upcoming service (sometimes called a \u201cmerged\u201d dataset). There are multiple [merge tools](https://gtfs.org/resources/gtfs/#gtfs-merge-tools) available that can be used to create a merged dataset from two different GTFS feeds._\n  - _At any time, the published GTFS dataset should be valid for at least the next 7 days, and ideally for as long as the operator is confident that the schedule will continue to be operated._\n  - _If possible, the GTFS dataset should cover at least the next 30 days of service._\n  - **All holidays observed within the valid period of the feed should be accounted for with the appropriate service reductions and/or additions.**\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

This however could be somewhat problematic as it may necessitate duplication of all associated data with the service_ids to properly encapsulate how the fare policy is applied.\n\n### Use cases\n\nAs a transit agency,\r\nI would like to promote my \"fare free week\" in GTFS Fares v2,\r\nSo that customers can see that transit is free this week, YAY!\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd columns `start_date` and `end_date` to `timeframes.txt`. These columns would be conditionally forbidden if the `service_id` was present.\n\n### Additional information\n\nExample use case in real life: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff67eecd-d1ca-46bf-8390-73daf64bba9f)\r\n\r\nRelated to #450.\r\n",

    "body": "The use of `TripUpdate.schedule_relationship = ADDED` [was unspecified and different producers / consumers used it in different ways](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/106). For example, it is sometimes used to specify additional departures on an existing route, but it is also used to specify departures which can't be matched to any existing trips.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to fully deprecate ADDED, and introduce NEW and REPLACEMENT, based on the implementation of OpenTripPlanner which specifies the whole journey to be added or replaced. Additional fields, such as headsigns, and pickup / drop-off types, are introduced as required to support the full specification of completely new trips.\r\n\r\n## `NEW`\r\nIn this proposal, `TripUpdate.schedule_relationship = NEW` should be used to add trips which do not duplicate an existing trip. Such trips are considered to be unrelated to any existing trips in the GTFS Static and can serve an arbitrary pattern, including completely new patterns not found in the GTFS Static.\r\n\r\nA typical use case is for relief trips for extra demand, typically after big events.\r\n\r\nNEW trips are intended as a migration target for existing feeds which use ADDED to specify new trips unrelated to the static GTFS, including OpenTripPlanner. `trip_id` in the `TripDescriptor` for new trips must be completely new (not found in GTFS static) and unique, and a `start_date` should also be specified as well (I am not using the word \"must\" here because it is permitted not to specify start_date to match scheduled trips, in this case the trip is assumed to run today). \r\n\r\nThe whole journey of the added trip must be specified, in stop order, as `StopTimeUpdate`s inside the `TripUpdate` without any omission. Fields are added to `TripProperties` and `StopTimeProperties` for esssential information such as names, headsigns, pickup / drop off types.\r\n\r\n## `REPLACEMENT`\r\nI propose to un-deprecate `TripUpdate.schedule_relationship = REPLACEMENT` as well. It works in the same way as `NEW`, apart from that the `TripDescriptor` must match one instance of a scheduled trip (like other values of `TripUpdate.schedule_relationship`), and that instance is replaced with the complete replacement trip specified in form of `StopTimeUpdate`s like an added trip. The original stop times in the GTFS static are not considered by the replacement trip in any form to avoid confusion. The replacement trip can serve an arbitrary pattern with an arbitrary schedule, the only expectation is that the passenger should associate the replacement trip to actually be a replacement of the original trip.\r\n\r\nA typical use case is for short-term timetable change, or short-term (near real-time) diversion, where the fact that the `trip_id` remains the same can be used by journey planners to notify the user that the booked service has been changed. (In particular, I have successfully used this feature to handle real-time train diversions in GB in OpenTripPlanner and route users to alight at diverted stops, which is something neither Google Maps nor Citymapper can do now)\r\n\r\nThis is the behaviour implemented in OpenTripPlanner, which is equivalent to deleting the matched trip, and processing the replacement `TripUpdate` as an ADDED trip mentioned above.\r\n\r\n### Relationship to `TripModification`\r\n`TripModification` provides a way to modify trips en-masse by specifying a list of trip IDs where the same detour can be applied. However, it is not suited to change the schedule on a per-trip basis, replacing the trip with a completely different schedule after any diversions with different running times (common due to pathing constraints on railways).\r\n\r\nIt should be forbidden to modify the same trip via a `REPLACEMENT` trip update and also via a `TripModification`.",

    "body": "### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nMy experience so far with complete producer-consumer Flex implementations has been that route deviation is exponentially more complex than any other use case. The current approach is to explicitly define polygons representing each pickup/drop-off zone between every stop-to-stop segment in a trip and then explicitly define their pickup/drop-off windows based on the timepoints they are sandwiched by. This is a very heavyweight approach due to the amount of data processing required both by the producer and consumer. One specific example is how it creates many geographical overlaps in small spaces which poses challenges for querying actual deviation trips. The problem increases the denser the stops/shape areas are. Implementing on the producer side is equally burdensome, especially when we consider the fact that route deviation is a modification of existing fixed routes and should lend itself well to a lighter-weight extension. Currently, if a producer without data automation tools wants to implement route deviation, they would need to draw polygons for each of those stop-to-stop segments, which would require at least a working knowledge of GIS (even the shortcuts are predicated on being proficient enough in GIS to know what those shortcuts are). That producer would also need to manually enter in each start/end pickup/drop-off window based on the surrounding stops (it's also unclear what should happen for cases for stops without arrival/departure times).\r\n\r\n### Use cases\r\n\r\nFixed routes that can deviate within a pre-defined boundary off the regular path of travel to pick up or drop off riders upon request.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAt first one might assume that adding a component specific to route deviation would not be backwards compatible with the Flex components already introduced into the spec. In reality, nothing in the current spec would actually contradict additional parameters specific to route deviation, because route deviation is currently handled by applying \"route category agnostic\" components of Flex to model the use case (i.e., there is nothing specific to route deviation in the spec).\r\n\r\nOne solution I've thought of would be one that does not utilize locations.geojson or the time windows at all but rather adds \"metadata\" fields to stop_times.txt. This is actually similar to how route deviation was handled in the original Flex specification but with slightly different rules, especially in light of the already-existing Flex components in the spec.\r\n\r\n### stop_times.txt (extended)\r\n\r\nField Name | Type | Presence | Description\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\npickup_deviation_radius | Non-negative float | Conditionally forbidden |  Radial distance in meters from the trip's shape between this stop and the following stop. This value indicates how far the vehicle may deviate from this segment to pick up a rider. A deviated pickup within this radius can only occur after this stop's `departure_time` and before the following stop's `arrival_time`. The trip must specify a `shape_id` for this field to be defined.<br><br>Forbidden if this is the last stop of the trip. Optional otherwise.\r\ndrop_off_deviation_radius | Non-negative float | Conditionally forbidden |  Radial distance in meters from the trip's shape between this stop and the following stop. This value indicates how far the vehicle may deviate from this segment to drop off a rider. A deviated drop-off within this radius can only occur after this stop's `departure_time` and before the following stop's `arrival_time`. The trip must specify a `shape_id` for this field to be defined.<br><br>Forbidden if this is the last stop of the trip. Optional otherwise.\r\ndeviated_pickup_type | Enum | Conditionally required | `0` or empty - No deviated pickup available. Forbidden if `pickup_deviation_radius` is defined.<br>`1` - Must phone agency to arrange a deviated pickup. Required if `pickup_deviation_radius` is defined.\r\ndeviated_drop_off_type | Enum | Conditionally required | `0` or empty - No deviated drop-off available. Forbidden if `drop_off_deviation_radius` is defined.<br>`1` - Must phone agency to arrange a deviated drop-off.<br>`2` - Must coordinate with driver to arrange a deviated drop-off.<br><br>Value of `1` or `2` is required if `drop_off_deviation_radius` is defined. Optional otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis covers the vast majority of route deviation services in the United States operate based off of a fixed radial value (\"3/4 of a mile off the fixed route\" for example), and even ones in which that radial value fluctuates stop-to-stop. This would not cover unique deviation situations like where the deviation zone is actually a custom area not tied to the shape, however those could still be covered by the agnostic Flex components currently being used to model route deviation.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely just a draft idea and needs to be further refined, but I think it could be a good start for rethinking how we do trip planning around route deviation long term.\r\n\r\nAs a completely unqualified thought experiment, I've worked out the kind of logic possibly needed to return a route deviation trip itinerary for a pickup using the above framework.\r\n\r\nFor pickup:\r\n1. Check for stop with deviation radius defined closest to requested location beyond walk threshold.\r\n2. Check if requested location is within radius value of shape_id between this stop\u2019s and next stop\u2019s shape_dist_traveled segment.\r\n3. Check if requested pickup time is after stop\u2019s departure_time and before next stop\u2019s arrival_time.\r\n4. If there\u2019s a match, then the trip planner displays that stop\u2019s arrival_time for the deviated pickup (potentially with factor/offset applied value) along with any booking_rule information for that stop_time.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nI would like to hear from consumers on whether such a solution would make it easier to provide better route deviation trip plans. If not, it would be equally valuable to hear other ideas. :)",

Both of these items may cause problems for data consumers where the request is rejected due to lack of a secure enough connection.\n\n### Use cases\n\nThis would happen when data is being requested using HTTP or HTTPS.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd a best practice that recommends using HTTPS with good health of the SSL certificates.\n\n### Additional information\n\nI'm assuming this is very obvious to some people, but it does happen out in the wild.",

MobilityData will use the following factors, including information from this backlog, to prioritize ideas/features:\r\n\r\n- The geographical diversity of interested organizations. (E.g., interest from multiple continents/countries versus just one.)\r\n- The diversity of organization types. (E.g., whether the interest comes from trip planners, public transit operators (agencies or private companies), the public sector, etc.)\r\n- The potential riderships that would benefit from the feature.\r\n- The complexity of reaching consensus.\r\n\r\nIn the past, we attempted to use ProductBoard to capture community intent, but it lacked transparency and failed to provide tangible value to the community. We are now trying to build a public backlog using Airtable.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the purpose of this Public Backlog and how it aligns with the overall community goals, please refer to [this detailed document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VF7OXohA-Ee4BuwPFmhI7mH5PNFkTzuaDWlvsKx9X-Q/edit).\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to share your thoughts or questions in this issue or in the document.",

Timing consists of delay and/or estimated time, and uncertainty.\r\n> \r\n> * `delay` should be used when the prediction is given relative to some existing schedule in GTFS.\r\n> * `time` should be given whether there is a predicted schedule or not. If both time and delay are specified, time will take precedence (although normally, time, if given for a scheduled trip, should be equal to scheduled time in GTFS + delay).\r\n\r\nHowever, for an `ADDED` or `DUPLICATED` trip, there is currently no means to specify the scheduled time of the added or duplicate trip (for example, if the duplicated trip is scheduled to run slower than the original).\r\n\r\n### Use cases\r\n\r\n* A train company wants to add a new, ad hoc trip, not on any existing trip patterns, which adheres to a schedule, for example, an event special.\r\n* A bus company wants to run a duplicate service timed 5 minutes before the original, but because of the slower boarding / alighting speed of the relief vehicle, it is planned to run slower than the original and eventually arrives the destination at the same time as the original.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nChange the definition of the message `StopTimeEvent` in GTFS-RT to be:\r\n\r\nTiming information for a single predicted event (either arrival or departure). Timing consists of delay and/or estimated time, and uncertainty.\r\n\r\n* delay should be used when the prediction is given relative to some existing schedule in GTFS.\r\n* time should be given whether there is a predicted schedule or not. If both time and delay are specified\r\n** For scheduled trips, time will take precedence (although normally, time, if given for a scheduled trip, should be equal to scheduled time in GTFS + delay).\r\n** For added and duplicated trips, if a delay is also specified, it represents the actual time for the new trip for which the scheduled time can be calculated\r\n* Uncertainty applies equally to both time and delay. The uncertainty roughly specifies the expected error in true delay (but note, we don't yet define its precise statistical meaning). It's possible for the uncertainty to be 0, for example for trains that are driven under computer timing control.\r\n\r\n|Field Name\t|Type\t|Required\t|Cardinality|\tDescription|\r\n|-----|----|----|-----|----|\r\n|delay\t|[int32](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto2/#scalar)|\tConditionally required\t|One\t|Delay (in seconds) can be positive (meaning that the vehicle is late) or negative (meaning that the vehicle is ahead of schedule). Delay of 0 means that the vehicle is exactly on time. <br>If `TripDescriptor.schedule_relationship` is `SCHEDULED`, the delay is measured against the GTFS static schedule.<br> If `TripDescriptor.schedule_relationship` is either `ADDED` or `DUPLICATED`, the delay is included in the actual `time` below, which must be provided. <br>If `TripDescriptor.schedule_relationship` is `UNSCHEDULED`, this field must be empty.<br>Either delay or time must be provided within a StopTimeEvent - both fields cannot be empty.|\r\n|time\t|[int64](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto2/#scalar)|\tConditionally required\t|One\t|Event as absolute time.

As promoted in #485, the headsigns field is being said the be \"recommended\". Therefore this creates a tension in assuming that data is missing when the headsigns data is not included.\n\n### Use cases\n\n Two examples from California are shown below:\r\n\r\nMorro Bay Transit:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af71d907-29d5-46f3-8d7f-7b355c67fd3d)\r\n\r\nDana Point Trolley:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f20f702-2f0a-4cba-9b48-0318bc076b40)\r\n\r\nI would assume there are other places throughout the world where headsigns aren't used or don't exist.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThere should be a some language within the specification that specifically notes how to note that headsign information is excluded. The spec could be rewritten so that when headsigns are not included, this constitutes an acknowledgment that headsigns aren't used for the trip in question. Otherwise, a flag could be added to note that headsings aren't used for a particular trip.\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

Loop routes\r\n2. Flex datasets\r\n\r\n## Solution proposed\r\nAdding a statement that headsigns is recommended for all services with headsign text displayed on the vehicle which may be used to distinguish amongst trips in a route.\r\n\r\nI acknowledge this isn't something we can easily validate automatically and trigger a WARNING for it in the [Canonical GTFS Schedule Validator](https://gtfs-validator.mobilitydata.org/). \r\nThat being said, the spec contains instances of must/required and recommended/should that can't easily be checked by an automatic validator and would have to be checked by other means, and we think this is definitely better than nothing. For example:\r\n\r\n- In [stop_times.stop_id](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#stop_timestxt): _All stops serviced during a trip must have a record in [stop_times.txt](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#stop_timestxt)._\r\n- in [pathways.min_width](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#pathwaystxt): _This field is recommended if the minimum width is less than 1 meter._\r\n- In [agency.agency_email](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#agencytxt): _This email address should be a direct contact point where transit riders can reach a customer service representative at the agency._\r\n\r\nRecommendations don't invalidate a GTFS dataset, this change is considered backwards-compatible.\r\n\r\n## Alternatives considered\r\nIn the GitHub issue, we've discussed adding a new `trips.has_headsigns` field that would have the _Recommended_ status and make `trips.trip_headsign` _Conditionally Required_ if `has_headsigns==1`, but then concluded the simple statement would lead to a good enough outcome with less complexity added to the spec.\r\n\r\nTagging folks involved in the GH issue @westontrillium @skinkie @antrim @evansiroky ",

In GTFS Realtime, both Alerts and TripUpdates can theoretically be used when trips/routes/route_types/stops are not in service. Although this seems very unlikely one would use TripUpdates for routes, both could be used for trips and stops. \r\n2. Alerts could imply that they are only used to communicate rider-facing messages, but Alerts are also the most efficient way to communicate that an entity is closed for extended periods, ensuring trip planners can adjust algorithms accordingly.\r\n\r\n## What the spec currently says\r\n- In Feed entities ([source](https://gtfs.org/realtime/feed-entities/service-alerts/#service-alerts)):\r\n\r\n> Delays and cancellations of individual trips should usually be communicated using [Trip updates](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/trip-updates.md).\r\n\r\n\r\n- In the GTFS Best Practices ([source](https://gtfs.org/realtime/best-practices/#alert)):\r\n\r\n> When canceling trips over several days, producers should provide TripUpdates referencing the given trip_ids and start_dates as CANCELED as well as an Alert with NO_SERVICE referencing the same trip_ids and TimeRange that can be shown to riders explaining the cancellation (e.g., detour).\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\nGiven that Alerts are easier to produce and are generally more efficient and informative in describing cancelations, we propose that:\r\n- If an Alert with Effect.NO_SERVICE exists and conflicts with values in TripUpdates, **Alerts should be considered the source of truth.** \r\n- ~~Alerts should be used for notifying that a stop will be out of service **for extended periods**.~~\r\n- Clarification: Alerts with Effect.NO_SERVICE should be used for notifying that a stop is out of service **and it affects many trips** instead of providing TripUpdates for all trips with the skipped stop time.\r\n- ~~Alerts **can be used** by consumers to modify trip planner behavior.~~\r\n- Clarification: Alerts with Effect.NO_SERVICE **can be used** by consumers to modify trip planner behavior. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds these three statements to the GTFS Realtime spec.\r\n\r\nDoes this seem like a reasonable solution?\r\nDo we need to add more details to what \"extended periods\" means?\r\n\r\nTagging folks who provided feedback to the issue @optionsome @dbabramov @gcamp @leonardehrenfried @IvanVolosyuk.

We are looking for a way to published scheduled reinforcement trips, but only have them available in travel information services after they have been acknowledged by the operator. For many reasons this cannot _only_ be achieved via GTFS-RT and duplication.\r\n\r\n### Use cases\r\n\r\nThe agency is aware that some routes are become crowded and apply extra vehicles. These extra services already have been blocked and have driver duties available.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAn extra column in trips.txt marking the trip is only available if published in GTFS-RT.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_",

We think there is value in calling out the latter explicitly using the terms associated with the Best Practices (_Recommended_ or _Should_), to promote higher-quality GTFS.\r\n\r\nWe looked at what are the most common optional features on the [Mobility Database](https://mobilitydatabase.org/): ~1500 GTFS Static datasets across 79 countries - note that the US accounts for approx half of this, so we also looked at non-US based data. These are the 6 top represented optional features, in both cases.\r\n\r\n|feature                  |all data|non-US data|\r\n|------------------------|--------|-----------|\r\n|Shapes                  |84%  |72%     |\r\n|Headsigns               |82%  |79%     |\r\n|Route Colors            |73%  |57%     |\r\n|Wheelchair Accessibility|62%  |41%     |\r\n|Feed Information        |62%  |43%     |\r\n|Location Types          |60%  |46%     |\r\n\r\nThere is currently [a PR open](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/470) for recommending Shapes in the spec.  \r\n\r\n## Issue\r\nThis issue is for making [`trips.trip_headsign`](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#tripstxt) recommended in the spec, given its use in production data across the globe.\r\nAmongst the feeds that don't have headsigns, I didn't find obvious cases where it wouldn't be needed. Do we know of any?\r\n\r\n## Solution proposed\r\nAdding the _Recommended_ presence requirement for `trip_headsign` (see all presence requirements [here](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#presence)).\r\nThis is considered a backwards-compatible change because it wouldn't change the validity of feeds that don't have headsigns. They would trigger a WARNING in the [canonical validator](https://gtfs-validator.mobilitydata.org/).",

Technically it is even possible to share shapes between trips that do not have the same stop sequence, but follow the same route-over-the-road or route-over-the-rail and use parts of a shape. For long distance busses shapes.txt might be enormously dense, copying many highways and city entrances, while the opposite might also be true and the shape would be more something that is intended for map matching.\r\n\r\n1. shapes.txt is currently a list, there is no file that defines the properties of a shape_id. I think we must introduce a new file to facilitate this, to allow to define if a shape is specific or abstracted, and is shared between unrelated stop sequences.\r\n2. The way how shapes are designed there is no formal requirement that at a stop it must be split (hence a shape point) exist, because the stop_times.txt defines an _offset_. I think it would be a very good best practice that such point does exist, hence a straight road with three stops would not just have two shape points (at the beginning and end) but also a point on which the stop can be projected\r\n",

So, if stops 1 and 4 were timepoints, but 2 and 3 were not, you'd have a valid GTFS that looks like this:\r\n\r\n|  stop_sequence | arrival_time | departure_time |\r\n|  ------ | ------ | ------ | \r\n1 | 00:00:00 | 00:00:00  |  \r\n2 |  |  |  \r\n3 |  |  |  \r\n4 | 00:10:00 | 00:10:00  |  \r\n\r\nHowever, producers realized that for multiple consumers to show consistent scheduled arrival and departure times at each stop (i.e., so consumers didn't interpolate them and come up with their own values), they would need to share arrival/departure times for each stop in the trip. A large number of GTFS producers started doing the following, even though technically it was against the GTFS spec:\r\n\r\n|  stop_sequence | arrival_time | departure_time |\r\n|  ------ | ------ | ------ | \r\n1 | 00:00:00 | 00:00:00  |  \r\n2 | 00:02:00 | 00:02:00 |  \r\n3 | 00:08:00 | 00:08:00 |  \r\n4 | 00:10:00 | 00:10:00  |  \r\n\r\nNow, to consumers, all the stops looked like timepoints, even though that wasn't the producer's intent.\r\n\r\nThe `timepoint` field was added to give producers a legitimate way to share times for each stop in the trip, while still correctly indicating which stops are timepoints.\r\n\r\nSo if producers want to provide times for every stop, they shouldn't be doing the above, and instead should provide the `timepoint` field:\r\n\r\n|  stop_sequence | arrival_time | departure_time | timepoint\r\n|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- |\r\n1 | 00:00:00 | 00:00:00  |  1\r\n2 | 00:02:00 | 00:02:00 |  0\r\n3 | 00:08:00 | 00:08:00 |  0\r\n4 | 00:10:00 | 00:10:00  |  1\r\n\r\nThis means as of today, IMHO, there are two valid ways to share arrival and departure times in GTFS. The first is the original GTFS spec without the timepoint field, where times are omitted for stops that are not timepoints:\r\n\r\n|  stop_sequence | arrival_time | departure_time |\r\n|  ------ | ------ | ------ | \r\n1 | 00:00:00 | 00:00:00  |  \r\n2 |  |  |  \r\n3 |  |  |  \r\n4 | 00:10:00 | 00:10:00  |  \r\n\r\nOr, if they want to provide times for every stop, they should provide timepoint values for the entire stop-times.txt.\r\n\r\n|  stop_sequence | arrival_time | departure_time | timepoint\r\n|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- |\r\n1 | 00:00:00 | 00:00:00  |  1\r\n2 | 00:02:00 | 00:02:00 |  0\r\n3 | 00:08:00 | 00:08:00 |  0\r\n4 | 00:10:00 | 00:10:00  |  1",

However, after its adoption, producers can define riders boarding and alighting geographic areas through `locations.geojson` (geometry: polygons) as well. In theory, an agency may exclusively offer zone-based demand-responsive services, in which case the feed may only contain `locations.geojson` without `stops.txt`.\r\n\r\n### Proposed change in this PR\r\nTherefore, suggest changing the presence of `stops.txt` from `Required` to `Conditionally required` (required if `locations.geojson` doesn't exist, optional otherwise). \r\n\r\n### GTFS validator behavior\r\n\r\nOnce the spec is modified, the GTFS validator can make corresponding adjustments, such as:\r\n- Both `stops.txt` and `locations.geojson` exist - no error\r\n- Either `stops.txt` or `locations.geojson` exists - no error\r\n- Neither `stops.txt` nor `locations.geojson` exists - error (missing required file stops.txt)\r\n\r\n**Conditionally required vs Optional**\r\nIf both `stops.txt` and `locations.geojson` are optional, the GTFS validator won't show an error when neither `stops.txt` nor `locations.geojson` exists. If there is no geographic information defining where riders boarding and alighting in the feed, the feed seems invalid to me. \r\n\r\nSince `stops.txt` is one of the fundamental file in GTFS, we plan to open a vote on this change.\r\ncc: @westontrillium @leonardehrenfried @tsherlockcraig @gcamp ",

What do you think about adding fields like\r\n**center_lat**\r\n**center_lon**\r\n**default_zoom**\r\nto the **feed_info.txt** file for this information?\n\n### Use cases\n\nIn an application where urban travel planning is done for different cities, the first thing to do is to center the selected city on the map. This information can be kept in a separate dataset or can be pulled from the selected package since it is dependent on the list of GTFS packages.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nMy suggestion is to add the following fields to your feed_info.txt file:\r\n**center_lat**\r\n**center_lon**\r\n**default_zoom**\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

It should be added that there isn't fundamental opposition by the OTP devs, it's just that it was never an important feature for any OTP user to actually change the routing based on alerts.\r\n\r\nThe [GTFS Realtime Best Practices](https://gtfs.org/realtime/best-practices/#alert) currently say:\r\n\r\n> When canceling trips over a number of days, producers should provide TripUpdates referencing the given trip_ids and start_datesas CANCELED as well as an Alert with NO_SERVICE referencing the same trip_ids and TimeRange that can be shown to riders explaining the cancellation (e.g., detour).\r\n\r\n### Solution proposed by @derhuerst\r\nAdd additional clarification that\r\n-  the NO_SERVICE Alert is intended for display to customers, while\r\n-  the CANCELED TripUpdates are intended to cause the trips/stop_times to be excluded from routing results",

It will update the vehicle's arrival time\r\n>       stop_sequence: 10\r\n>       # with the default delay of 0 (on time) and propagate this update\r\n>       # for the rest of the vehicle's stops.\r\n>     }\r\n\r\nThe reference documentation for a StopTimeUpdate message however states that the _arrival_ and _departure_ fields are conditionally required, with the following clause:\r\n\r\n> If schedule_relationship is empty or SCHEDULED, either arrival or departure must be provided within a StopTimeUpdate - both fields cannot be empty. arrival and departure may both be empty when schedule_relationship is SKIPPED. If schedule_relationship is NO_DATA, arrival and departure must be empty.\r\n\r\nThis suggests the example should specify at least one of the fields, or explicitly set schedule_relationship to _NO_DATA_. In my understanding, using _NO_DATA_ will effectively reset the delays to zero and stop propagation of any previously specified delay. _NO_DATA_ is however defined as \"no realtime timing information available\"\u2014which may not be semantically correct when we know the actual delay to be zero.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts?",

Additionally, it's out of date.\r\n2. the GTFS Schedule revision history appears [after the spec amendment process](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/CHANGES.md). \r\nWe're reorganizing content on [gtfs.org](https://gtfs.org/) to enhance the user experience. The revision history will be placed in a new Technical Documentation section, and the Spec Amendment Process will be moved to a Community section, which will include information on how to participate. To achieve this, we need these to be two separate documents. Also, the revision history is actively maintained, while the Spec Amendment Process rarely changes, so having them in separate documents will make things clearer.\r\n\r\n**Solution included in this PR**\r\n- [x] Moved the GTFS Schedule revision history out of the spec amendment process in its own document\r\n- [x] Added the GTFS Realtime revision history to this repo\r\n- [x] Updated the GTFS Realtime revision history\r\n\r\nThis doesn't change the spec or its amendment process, so I believe a vote is not needed.

Option 2 causes headaches and sometimes isn't supported by consumers at all. As a result, it would make sense to recommend that producers use trip_id in all cases.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\nAdd a mention in the [TripDescriptor](https://gtfs.org/realtime/reference/#message-tripdescriptor) trip_id description that for SCHEDULED trips that are not frequency-based, the identification of the trip should be done via trip_id.\r\n\r\nTagging folks involved on slack @leonardehrenfried @e-lo @lauriemerrell @gcamp @doconnoronca @willcanderson",

One of the applications of this identifier is to allow mapping travel information among different mobility-data standards.\r\n\r\n**What we do:** We will include the SJYID in our GTFS Schedule exports and intend to do the same for GTFS realtime. \r\n\r\n**What we realized:** Discussions with other European public transport providers have shown that we may not be the only ones who need such a construct. Particularly, to ensure compatibility with other exchange formats.\r\n\r\n**What we suggest:** Although this concept has apparently been explicitly excluded (see https://gtfs.org/realtime/reference/#message-tripdescriptor & screenshot), we suggest to re-visit this and consider including a new field \"trip_global_id\" that allows to combine/aggregate multiple trips.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/google/transit/assets/32004282/c2b883e5-551b-402f-b8cc-63841d0f0338)\r\n\r\nThank you for your input.\r\n\n\n### Use cases\n\nCombining GTFS realtime data with NeTEx, HRDF, etc.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAmend GTFS Schedule's trips.txt with a field \"trip_global_id\"\r\nAmend GTFS realtime's TripDescriptor to include \"trip_global_id\" referencing the scheduled \"trip_global_id\"\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

What are other GTFS files currently recommended? \r\n\r\n[feed_info.txt](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#feed_infotxt) is a recommended file. If it's not included in a GTFS dataset, the canonical GTFS Schedule Validator triggers a [missing_recommended_file](https://gtfs-validator.mobilitydata.org/rules.html#missing_recommended_file-rule). \r\n\r\n2. Why aren't we just making all optional files/fields recommended? \r\n\r\nCertain Optional files/fields are dependent on the service (e. g. `timeframes.txt` is for modeling fares based on time of day), whereas other files can and _should_ always be added regardless of the type of service being modeled (e. g. feed_info.txt). We think there is value in calling out the latter explicitly using the term `recommend` to promote higher quality GTFS.\r\n\r\n3. With the addition of GTFS Flex, if we model a zone-based demand-responsive service, we don't need `shapes.txt`. We could not use the _Recommended_ presence requirement the same way we do for [feed_info.txt]([feed_info.txt](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#feed_infotxt)). That being said, we could add it in its description (similarly to the field [`min_width`](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#pathwaystxt)), and write custom logic for triggering [missing_recommended_file](https://gtfs-validator.mobilitydata.org/rules.html#missing_recommended_file-rule) in the validator only when relevant.\r\n\r\n**Would you support this change?**\r\nTagging folks who engaged in adding the Recommended presence into GTFS @e-lo @antrim @bdferris-v2 @NomeQ @gcamp @evansiroky @markstos @westontrillium @derhuerst @doconnoronca\r\n",

Capacity would be used to indicate how busy a vehicle is if the real-time passenger load is provided. The vehicle type would be useful to indicate when a rail vehicle has been replaced by a bus.\r\n\r\nThis could also be used for reporting fleet information in a standard format for analyses by other levels of government and the public.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nA new vehicles.txt file in the GTFS static file to describe the capacity, accessibility and features of individual vehicles or vehicle ranges. It would apply to buses, LRT, subway cars, rail cars and even ferries.\r\n\r\nFields could include:\r\n\r\n- Id: Corresponds to the id in the VehicleDescriptor in the real-time data. Required and unique\r\n- High_Id: If the vehicle description covers a range of identical vehicles the Id is the lower end of the range and High_Id is the high end. Only the numbers can increment. Any non-numeric characters must not change. Leading zero in the Id are maintained.\r\n- Label: Corresponds to the label in the VehicleDescriptor in the real-time data.\r\n- High_Label: If the vehicle description covers a range of identical vehicles the Label is the lower end of the range and High_Label is the high end. Only the numbers can increment. Any non-numeric characters must not change. Leading zero in the Label are maintained. The range must be the same size as the range covered by the Id and High_Id.\r\n- Vehicle_Type: Could match the values of [Route_Type](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#routestxt)\r\n- Manufacturer\r\n- Model\r\n- Year: Year ordered\r\n- Length_Feet\r\n- Length_Meters\r\n- Articulations\r\n- Number_of_Levels\r\n- Seated_Capacity\r\n- Standing_Capacity\r\n- Wheelchair_Capacity\r\n- Interior_Bicycle_Capacity\r\n- Exterior_Bicycle_Capacity\r\n- Bicycle_Notes: A text description of how bicycles are stored and any limitations that may apply, such as times when they are disallowed. Translatable\r\n- Luggage: Has space for luggage that is larger than carry-on luggage. 1- Luggage rank in the passenger area; 2- Luggage storage under or behind the passenger area (such as a coach bus).\r\n- Luggage_Notes: A text description of how luggage is stored and any limitations that may apply. Translatable\r\n- Restrooms: Number of restrooms in the vehicle\r\n- AirConditioned: 1- Has functioning Air Conditioning\r\n- AC_Plugs: Number of AC power plug that follow the local standard available to passengers\r\n- USB_Plugs: Number of USB type-A ports available for device charging\r\n- WiFi: 1- Internet access through WiFi with no login required; 2- Internet access with free login required; 3- Internet Access with payment or paid membership\r\n- WiFi_Notes: Description of how the access the Internet through WiFi and any limitation it has. Translatable\r\n- Number_of_Doors: If the vehicle has doors on both sides, use the number of doors per side.\r\n- Boarding_Level: 1 - High platform level boarding; 2 - Low platform level boarding; 3- Steps to board; 4- Boarding varies by station\r\n- Boarding_Steps: Number of steps to board\r\n- Accessible_Boarding: If there are steps to board, this shows the vehicle may be accessibly boarder. 0-Not accessible; 1-Level boarding; 2- Ramp can be deployed; 3- Lift can be deployed\r\n- Accessible_Door: Door number at supports accessible boarding, where 1 is the first door in the direction of travel\r\n- Accessibility_Notes: Text information about how to board with a mobility device and any limitations. Translatable\r\n- Next_Stop_Announcement: 1- Audible next stop announcements are made in this vehicle for the vision impaired\r\n- Next_Stop_Display: 1- There are interior displays showing the name of the next stop for the hearing impaired\r\n- Special_Decoration: A brief description of a special wrap or modification of the vehicle either seasonal or long term. Translatable\r\n- Propulsion: 1- Unpowered, moved by another unit; 2- Overhead wire; 3- Third rail electric; 4- Battery electric; 5- Hydrogen; 6- ICE-battery hybrid; 7- Internal combustion engine; 8- Cable pulled; 9- Stream engine!?!?!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_",

If this field refers to a station, the transfer rule applies to all its child stops. Refering to a station is forbiden for `transfer_types` 4 and 5.\r\n\r\nBased on the description and the discussion in [PR#303](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/303), it should indicate that `from_stop_id` and `to_stop_id` cannot be empty, and it cannot be a \"station\" (location_type =1) if `transfer_type` is 4 or 5.\r\n\r\nHowever, some community members may interpret it as:\r\n- `from_stop_id` is required for `transfer_type` 1, 2, and 3; optional for `transfer_type` 4 and 5 OR\r\n- `from_stop_id` is required for `transfer_type` 1, 2, and 3; forbidden for `transfer_type` 4 and 5\r\n\r\nTo prevent such confusion from happening again, we propose the following modification:\r\n\r\n### Changes in this PR\r\n- Change presence from Conditionally Required to Required. According to the definition of presence `Required` - \"The field or file must be included in the dataset and contain a valid value for each record\", these 2 fields should be `Required`.\r\n- Remove the word \"forbidden\" from description to avoid potential confusion.\r\n\r\n+@gcamp - the main contributor of [PR#303](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/303)",

This confuses riders as they see buses as sometimes early while that is not really the case.  Sometimes a bus might arrive 3+ minutes early then leave but that is within scheduling's accuracy constraints, so people miss the bus (late is obviously less important but equally relevant for non-timepoint transfers for leg changes).\r\n\r\nIs it a good practice to populate the uncertainty field when we know the typical spread of the approximation, leaving delay as 0 to cause a +/- seconds in effect?\r\n\r\nThe closest I found discussing this was:\r\n\r\n[Clarify definition of \"frequency-based\" trips](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/47) and [Add prediction certainty #111](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/111) and my question isn't clearly answered by the current definition @ [message StopTimeEvent](https://gtfs.org/realtime/reference/#message-stoptimeevent).",

However, after its adoption, producers can define riders boarding and alighting geographic areas through `locations.geojson` (geometry: polygons) as well. In theory, an agency may exclusively offer zone-based demand-responsive services, in which case the feed may only contain `locations.geojson` without `stops.txt`.\r\n\r\n### Proposed change\r\n\r\nTherefore, we suggest changing the presence of `stops.txt` from `Required` to `Conditionally required` (required if `locations.geojson` doesn't exist). \r\n\r\n### GTFS validator behavior\r\n\r\nOnce the spec is modified, the GTFS validator can make corresponding adjustments, such as:\r\n- Both `stops.txt` and `locations.geojson` exist - no error\r\n- Either `stops.txt` or `locations.geojson` exists - no error\r\n- Neither `stops.txt` nor `locations.geojson` exists - error (missing required file stops.txt)\r\n\r\nPlease share any thoughts you have here. We plan to open a PR soon.",

    "body": "**TL;DR: we propose to officially harmonize the name GTFS-Static**\r\n\r\n**Issue Description:**\r\n\r\nThere has been a longstanding debate surrounding its naming conventions, particularly concerning the term \"Schedule.\" As the GTFS specification has evolved, it has become evident that the term \"Schedule\" may no longer comprehensively encapsulate the diverse range of functionalities available today. Moreover, the interchangeability of terms like \"Schedule\" and \"Static\" has led to confusion among users.\r\n\r\n**Background:**\r\n\r\n- GTFS Static has been utilized across various platforms and resources, exemplified in [Google's GTFS Static Overview](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs) and [OpenTransportData Swiss - GTFS Page](https://opentransportdata.swiss/en/cookbook/gtfs/).\r\n  \r\n- Confusion persists as evidenced by the interchangeability of \"GTFS Schedule\" and \"GTFS Static\" in references such as [Google Transit GTFS Schedule Reference](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference), which redirects to GTFS.org.\r\n\r\n**Community Insight:**\r\n\r\n- Community member @gcamp has expressed concern over the ambiguity of terms, advocating for a shift towards clarity. They suggest a nomenclature like \"GTFS-Static,\" which better reflects the essence of the static GTFS dataset encompassing more than just schedules. As @gcamp remarked:\r\n\r\n> Is \u201c[GTFS Schedule](https://gtfs.org/schedule/)\u201d an official name? The GTFS real time spec refers it as \u201c[(CSV) GTFS](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/proto/gtfs-realtime.proto#L346)\u201d which is probably worst. I would prefer something like \u201cGTFS-Static\u201d because represent better what the static GTFS is (more than just schedule).\r\n\r\n**Proposal:**\r\n\r\n- It is proposed to replace all instances of \"Schedule\" with \"Static\" throughout the documentation.\r\n  \r\n- Additionally, the descriptive text will explicitly acknowledge the historical usage of \"Schedule\" and its interchangeability with \"Static\" while emphasizing the latter as the preferred term moving forward.\r\n  \r\n**Rationale:**\r\n\r\n- With the introduction of features like GTFS-Flex and Pathways, GTFS has evolved beyond solely representing schedules. The defining characteristic remains the static nature of the data.\r\n  \r\n**Action Items:**\r\n\r\n- Amend documentation to substitute \"Schedule\" with \"Static\" consistently.\r\n  \r\n- Enhance descriptive text to elucidate the historical context and the preference for \"Static\" over other terms.\r\n  \r\n**Benefits:**\r\n\r\n- Enhanced clarity and consistency in GTFS documentation.\r\n  \r\n- Mitigation of confusion among users regarding terminology.\r\n  \r\n- Alignment with the evolving nature of GTFS specifications and functionalities.\r\n\r\n",

At the workgroup meeting on February 27th, the following consensus was reached:\r\n\r\n- Predicates for `from_network_id` and `to_network_id` will be added first, followed by the addition of other predicates such as `from_stop_id` and `to_stop_id`.\r\n- `from_network_id` and `to_network_id` are required fields, and initially will be restricted to the same network_id. We will consider relaxing this for different `network_id` later.\r\n\r\n### Changes in this PR\r\n\r\n- Add **Effective Fare Leg** in term definition\r\n- Add `fare_leg_join_rules.txt`\r\n- Modify `network_id`, `from_area_id`, `to_area_id`, `from_timeframe_group_id`, `to_timeframe_group_id` in `fare_leg_rules.txt` for effective fare leg\r\n\r\nFor previous discussions please see the [working group meeting note](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d3g5bMXupdElCKrdv6rhFNN11mrQgEk-ibA7wdqVLTU/edit#heading=h.ktutpncuq80i) and [issue#346](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/346)\r\n\r\nPlease go through the changes and feel free to share your thoughts/questions here.\r\n",

    "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nRecently, community members from Asia, Europe, and North America have pointed out the current GTFS missing functionality of defining conceptual grouping of stations/stops  (or lacking \"another-level\" of hierarchy of stations/stops (Station cluster)) \r\n\r\nHere are some relevant discussion records recently:\r\n- [Thread #1 in gtfs slack channel\r\n](https://mobilitydata-io.slack.com/archives/C3FFFKX9C/p1704400098457329)\r\n- [Thread #2 in gtfs slack channel](https://mobilitydata-io.slack.com/archives/C3FFFKX9C/p1710710188594949)\r\n- [2024-02-27 GTFS Fares v2 working group meeting note \r\n](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d3g5bMXupdElCKrdv6rhFNN11mrQgEk-ibA7wdqVLTU/edit#heading=h.ktutpncuq80i)\r\n\r\nMembers from the Association for Open Data of Public Transportation [ODPT, JP] and the Japan Bus Information Association have also brought up this issue to us.\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\nAccording to the current specification, `location_type=1` is \"station\" (a physical structure or area that contains one or more platforms). This hierarchy doesn't provide functionality for defining station/stop grouping that riders conceptually think of it.\r\n\r\nBased on the information we've gathered, having a new mechanism could be beneficial for the following use cases:\r\n\r\n1. Directing via station entrance or directing via street networks\r\nFor example, There are a train station and multiple adjacent bus stations on a public street, and they can share the same or similar station names. According to the current description of `location_type=1`, it seems these adjacent bus stops should not be included within the hierarchy of this train station (`parent_station`). When these bus stops are independent, consumers can correctly direct riders using the street network, rather than mistakenly guiding riders to use entrances(and pathways). However, this approach may have some drawbacks, such as:\r\n- Confusion in search results when bus stops share the same name as the train station.\r\n- Unable to set service alerts for the entire conceptual group. <br>\r\nOn the other hand, some producers may include these bus stops within the hierarchy of the train station. However, doing so will lead consumers to give riders incorrect directions (using entrances and pathways). <br>\r\nThe current GTFS lacks a mechanism to define this conceptual grouping while also able to distinguish whether riders need to pass through an entrance. This could potentially be achieved by adding a field or introducing a higher-level hierarchy (station cluster).\r\n\r\n2. Searching and visualization\r\nConsidering another example: there are multiple adjacent heavy rail stations with their own physical structure and entrances. They serve different routes/agencies and have the same station names. The current GTFS cannot define this station \"cluster\" that have a higher-level conceptual grouping. When riders search for this station name, consumers may provide them with an incorrect station, causing confusion.<br>\r\nIn this particular example, a higher-level of hierarchy (station cluster) seems necessary if we want to group these stations together, since each of them also serves as a parent station for their own entrances and stops(platforms).\r\n\r\n3. Service alerts\r\nProducers can directly set service alerts for the entire conceptual group, such as the entire train/subway station complex or multiple adjacent bus stops with identical station names.\r\n\r\n4. Effective Fare Leg\r\nWhen the fares v2 working group discussed rules for treating two or more legs as a single leg for fare calculation purposes, we considered how to formulate station-related semantics, how to include stop pairs, and different modes.  A functionality of defining conceptual grouping might help to formulate fare_leg_join_rules.\r\n\r\nPlease share any examples for the above use cases, any other relevant use cases, which use cases are more critical for your region, or any other thoughts here.",

    "body": "### Introduce yourself\n\nHi all! I'm Michael. I'm new here. I'm not a part of any GTFS producing/consuming organization. Just a daily rider!\n\n### Ask a question\n\nThe GTFS spec [defines three sign constraints](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#field-signs) for numeric fields: non-negative, non-zero, and positive. They are currently applied to integer (e.g. frequencies.headway_secs) and float (e.g. pathways.length) field types. Presumably, they could also apply to currency_amount fields. Currently, no field has more than 1 sign constraint.\r\n\r\nOne field has a constraint that is not defined. pathways.stair_count is constrained as a \"non-null integer\". What could \"non-null\" mean?\r\n- If it means the value cannot be 0, should the field be a \"non-zero integer\" with no requirement?\r\n- If it means the value cannot be empty (and 0 is a valid value), should the field be \"integer\" and be (conditionally) required?\r\n- Could it mean both non-zero and non-empty?\r\n\r\nThe short resolution to this issue is that the field type could be changed to \"non-zero integer\".\r\n\r\nThe much longer resolution would be... if the field definition has to change to align with the accepted sign constraints, maybe this is an opportunity to further clarify the spec. The non-zero constraint seems to exist to prevent \"stairs\" with 0 steps. However, it also means that a \"walkway\" must either leave stair_count undefined or define it with a non-zero number of steps. If a walkway having a stair_count is allowed, then a 0 value should be allowed (even though this is redundant) and the field should not be non-zero constrained. If a walkway having a stair_count is not allowed, then the field can be non-zero constrained but it should also be conditionally forbidden for non-stairs pathways. Is there any reason why the field should _not_ be conditionally forbidden _and_ still be constrained to non-zero integer?\r\n\r\n**TL;DR: The field type of stair_count is not well defined. A quick fix it to make it \"non-zero\". I think a better fix is to make it conditionally forbidden (and maybe also non-zero).**",

The proposed changes are informed by interviews, workshops, and community conversations conducted by MobilityData.\r\n\r\n## What are we trying to solve?\r\nProposing changes to GTFS has been a cumbersome process, leading to delayed outcomes and uncertainties. The top-priority issues include insufficient visibility on proposals, limited reviews, and a vague process before the Pull Request stage.\r\n\r\n### What is not included in phase 2? \r\nThe following items will be covered in Phase 3 of the governance as highlighted in the [phasing plan](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/413): \r\n\r\n- Adding a lightweight process for smaller changes\r\n- Other editorial changes on the spec amendment process\r\n- Including other ways of contributing than via a Pull Request\r\n- Add a visualization\r\n\r\n# Proposed Changes Overview\r\nThis proposal suggests a series of changes to the Specification Amendment Process, summarized below:\r\n\r\n| Change                                  | Description                                                                                                     | Why?                                                                                                                                                                       |\r\n| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| Adding an earlier voting stage          | Introduce a two-step voting scheme to increase community engagement before the final vote.                    | Enhance visibility and encourage community participation, addressing issues identified too late and reducing uncertainties.                                                 |\r\n| Introducing majority voting           | Replace the second vote with an 80% majority vote, restricting the -1 vote to the initial stage.               | Overcome barriers for early adopters, increase participation, and carefully define changes allowed between the two votes.                                                    |\r\n| Increasing voting requirements           | Incorporate a new minimum 5 votes requirement, along with increased minimum consumer and producer requirements. | Prevent a reduced number of contributors from pushing changes and ensure diverse perspectives in the voting processes.                                                       |\r\n| Formalizing review guidelines           | Create a new section to guide community reviews on GTFS spec change proposals at the voting stage.               | Address uncertainties around thorough reviews and ensure decisions align with the long-term sustainability of GTFS.                                                        |\r\n| Formalizing steps before Pull Request   | Extend the process to include an ideation step before the Pull Request, refining solutions through community conversations. | Account for vital discussions held before the creation of a proposal at the Pull Request stage, improving the quality of proposals.                                          |\r\n| Formalizing major roles and responsibilities | Introduce a new section to provide clarity on the main roles involved in the specification amendment process. | Clarify the players and their responsibilities, especially for newcomers, in the current process.                                                                         |\r\n\r\n# Proposed Alternatives\r\n[This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z3w9Gx-Bg6DUi9fn4O73HrPQ7YWXxZyMGoMk5uvlcMk/edit?usp=sharing) proposes two alternatives for the Specification Amendment Process, each with its unique characteristics:\r\n\r\n## Alternative A: First vote in the GitHub Pull Request\r\n- First voting stage occurs in a GitHub Pull Request, confirming community alignment with spec changes.\r\n- Detailed steps outlined in [Annex 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zBBEjiBPJ-qCPq4-zhesyViQR3QCn77DstURoxm1FbM/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n## Alternative B: First vote in the GitHub Issue\r\n- First voting stage takes place in a GitHub Issue, confirming community alignment before detailed spec changes.\r\n- Detailed steps outlined in [Annex 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1veTxJIwqUDLUoa6LkSPWF3FbvbU1sXChNAVp72sUn5U/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Comparison of Alternatives\r\nBoth alternatives address the identified governance issues in slightly different ways. Here's a summary of how each alternative addresses the key issues:\r\n\r\n| Identified Issue                               | Alternative A                                    | Alternative B                                              |\r\n| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| First adopters impacted by last-minute changes   | Solved: More visibility before implementation by early adopters. | Partially Solved: More visibility before a fully developed proposal. |\r\n| Insufficient engagement in early stages          | Partially Solved: Formalized ideation phase with open discussions. | Solved: Structured requirements for early-stage discussions.  |\r\n| High barrier to entry                            | Partially Addressed: Clearer process before the Pull Request. | Partially Addressed: Clearer process before the Pull Request. |\r\n\r\n# Documents for review\r\n\r\nMain body of work:\r\n- [Overview: Phase 2: Changes to Voting and Reviews](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z3w9Gx-Bg6DUi9fn4O73HrPQ7YWXxZyMGoMk5uvlcMk/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\nAttachments: Details and Clarifications:\r\n- [Annex 1: Alternative A Details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zBBEjiBPJ-qCPq4-zhesyViQR3QCn77DstURoxm1FbM/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n- [Annex 2: Alternative B Details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1veTxJIwqUDLUoa6LkSPWF3FbvbU1sXChNAVp72sUn5U/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n- [Annex 3: Roles and Review Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zKNOIFUM8FNBpYzniIbRynHAZbD0OIj71T11QDK28Vo/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n# What's Next?\r\n1. **Review the Overview**: Review the general overview and share your thoughts: [Overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z3w9Gx-Bg6DUi9fn4O73HrPQ7YWXxZyMGoMk5uvlcMk/edit?usp=sharing), \r\n\r\n2. **Deep dive**: Dive deep into the attachments for details: [Annex 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zBBEjiBPJ-qCPq4-zhesyViQR3QCn77DstURoxm1FbM/edit?usp=sharing), [Annex 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1veTxJIwqUDLUoa6LkSPWF3FbvbU1sXChNAVp72sUn5U/edit?usp=sharing), and [Annex 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zKNOIFUM8FNBpYzniIbRynHAZbD0OIj71T11QDK28Vo/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n3. **Provide Feedback**: Share your thoughts, suggestions, or concerns by commenting on this GitHub issue and/or in the respective documents mentioned above. \r\n\r\n4. **Save the date**: On **March 13, 2024**, MobilityData will be holding 2 meetings to present each alternative, and hold a guided discussion based on the comments towards an eventual consensus.

    "body": "### Introduce yourself\n\nJuliet Eldred, Project Manager, [Trillium/Optibus](https://trilliumtransit.com/)\n\n### Ask a question\n\nTrillium has been producing translations.txt files for a client's project, and while the translations data did not seem to have any issues being ingested into the Transit App, when my colleague tried to submit the feed with a translations.txt file for Google Transit, it returned a \"Value of the language column from the translations.txt file\" error in Google's validator (see below)\r\n![image](https://github.com/google/transit/assets/21694972/53e0dc13-c407-41a6-bf63-c9a93e851bf3)\r\n\r\nI took a closer look at the spec, and under the [feed_info section](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#feed_infotxt) (see feed_lang), it says to use [ISO 639-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-2_codes) codes for the language (which are 3-letter codes, eg \"spa\" for spanish), and this is what I used for all the language codes as I was under the impression that it was the standard to use this for all language codes. \r\n![image](https://github.com/google/transit/assets/21694972/c8642c7c-67c6-469f-afe0-76984623fdb1)\r\n\r\nHowever, upon further investigation, I believe I was wrong, and this is why the feed is returning errors in Google's validator:  \r\n- Under the [\"language\" field in translations.txt](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#translationstxt), the specific standard to use for the language code is not explicitly defined \r\n![image](https://github.com/google/transit/assets/21694972/42218c15-c666-4c3e-9e9d-d32a2ed9096f)\r\n- But further down on the page, [under \"field types\"](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#translationstxt), it defines \"language code\" as using an IETF BCP 47 language code, which is only a two-letter code (e.g. \"en\" for english). \r\n![image](https://github.com/google/transit/assets/21694972/26b97f38-3efa-4a9f-b1ad-aa42ec22b287)\r\nI'm not sure if this was there when I initially created the translations.txt data for this feed in mid-2023 or if I had missed it entirely, but the fact that it's buried at the bottom of the page and not more clearly incorporated into the main body of the spec description makes it easy for errors like this to happen. \r\n\r\nIn short, I'd like to request a few things:\r\n1. Could someone clarify which specific international standard language code to use for each particular field in translations.txt (e.g. ISO 639-2 or IETF BCP 47) so that feeds with translations.txt files can get through the validator?\r\n2. Since the documentation of this on GTFS.org is pretty vague, would it be possible to update the documentation to be more explicit about the specific language code standard required? \r\n\r\nPlease don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or clarifications - my email is juliet@trilliumtransit.com ",

    "body": "Based on the Issue [Static file version information is missing in the real-time data feed](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/362) opened by @Gerriko, I am proposing adding two new fields to the feed header to provide information on the GTFS file to be used with the GTFS real time data.\r\n\r\nThe feed_version would match the feed_version in the feed_info.txt file of the GTFS. This indicates which version of the GTFS file is currently being used by the real time data so the consumer knows exactly when to switch to a new file. It can also be used to identify when to check for a new GTFS file.\r\n\r\nThe GTFS_url would point to the url of the GTFS file. Sometimes agencies have multiple GTFSs and it's not clear which one is to be used. It provides the flexibility to allow the url to point to the upcoming GTFS file, but it is recommended to point to the one being used.\r\n\r\nThe next step would be for a producer to add support for this feature. This might be well suited for the @MBTA to implement it as they update their GTFS every few days, sometimes with last minute changes.\r\n ",

The only difference is that this PR is based on the current spec, while PR#388 is based on the spec from July last year.\r\n\r\nThe Flex specification proposal is about to enter the voting stage. Due to numerous spec changes since last July, PR#388 has many conflicts with the current spec. To avoid unexpected changes to the current spec during conflict resolution, we have decided to open a new PR.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR is opened, all potential future changes will occur here, and PR#388 will not have any updates. PR#388 will be temporarily kept for contextual reference and will be closed afterward. For details on all previous discussions, please refer to [PR#388](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/388) and the [working group meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ap7gXjCOa2pF1-sK8LonyNH-VO668Mq-vZAIR_Adhy4/edit#heading=h.hmvo53ak6eh6).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we have created a [data example page](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs.org/pull/301) in the MobilityData/gtfs.org repo to help better understand this proposal. We plan to publish these data examples on gtfs.org once this proposal pass the vote. Some descriptions in this spec proposal will directly link to this data example page on gtfs.org.\r\n\r\nBelow is an overview of this GTFS-Flex proposal:\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### The changes in this PR are:\r\n\r\n- Modify file:\r\n  - Modify `stop_times.txt` to clarify elements of the current specification necessary to inform data consumers of how to interpret the added and extended files and fields.\r\n  - Modify `stops.stop_id` to ensure unique ID across all `stops.stop_id`, locations.geojson `id`, and `location_group_id` values.\r\n- Extend file:\r\n  - Extend `stop_times.txt` with `location_group_id` and `location_id` to allow trips referencing location group and/or GeoJSON location in dedicated fields.\r\n  - Extend `stop_times.txt` with `start_pickup_drop_off_window` and `end_pickup_drop_off_window` to define the time that demand responsive transportation service becomes available/ends in a GeoJSON location, location group, or stop.\r\n  - Extend `stop_times.txt` with `pickup_booking_rule_id` and `drop_off_booking_rule_id` to define links to booking rules.\r\n- Add new file:\r\n  - `location_groups.txt` & `location_group_stops.txt` to allow grouping of stops which allow predetermined groups of these features to be specified on individual rows of `stop_times.txt`.\r\n  - `locations.geojson`, to define zones (`Polygon` or `Multipolygon`) where riders can request either pickup or drop off.\r\n  - `booking_rules.txt`, to define the booking rules that provide riders information about how to request service.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nPlease help review this PR. Support resources from first adopters for voting will be released later.\r\n  ",

    "body": "# Describe the problem\r\n\r\nWe, the French National Access Point (NAP), have held workshops about carpooling lines with several main actors (Ecov, Cityway, Transit, InstantSystem, Monkey Factory, Grenoble Alpes M\u00e9tropole).\r\n\r\nThe conclusions of the workshop show that to model carpooling lines correctly, we would need the following elements:\r\n- new values for `route_type` in _routes.txt_\r\n  - Carpooling line (group)\r\n    - Carpooling line with application and with departure guarantee\r\n    - Carpooling line with application and without departure guarantee\r\n    - Carpooling line without application (spontaneous)\r\n\r\nAnd also:\r\n- trips description (as in _routes.txt_)\r\n  - This new column will be used, in case of carpooling lines, for adding information about the departure guarantee, the necessity of using an application or not, etc.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to get the discussion going to move the subject forward before presenting any PR, especially for route types for which we are very unsure about what the right path is:\r\nmodifying the route type to accommodate for this new need\r\npropose a PR to update the Extended GTFS Route types ([link](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/extended-route-types)) (but the risk is that our specific requests could be not accepted, or take a long time to validate)\r\ncreating a custom extension, like Google did for extended route types (France specific?)\r\nsuggesting a better way to modelize services like this in GTFS (longer term)\r\n\r\n# Use cases\r\n\r\n## Carpooling line description\r\nA carpooling line is a trip defined like a bus line : precise stops and destinations. Conductors following their journey on this \u201cline\u201d can open their car to passengers. They must use the designated stops. Conductors are not professionals of the road, they can receive a money incentive from collectives, or share their costs with passengers. They make the same trip with or without passengers, apart from detours to reach their stops.\r\n\r\nThere are no timetables for lines, but a frequency (waiting time estimation) depending on the time of the day. The frequency could be very high at the start and end of days.\r\n \r\nSome lines, at specific times, provide departure guarantees to passengers. For example, if a passenger waits more than 15 minutes, a taxi solution could be proposed, without fees.\r\n\r\nThe majority of carpooling lines use mobile applications to inform drivers about stops and waiting passengers, and to inform passengers when drivers have arrived. The app is also used to certify the journey and give the money incentive.\r\n\r\n## Context : carpooling in the wild\r\nSeveral french actors already produce GTFS for their carpooling lines, with `route_type = bus`. Examples : Ecov with several GTFS files : [M\u2019covoit](https://transport.data.gouv.fr/datasets/horaires-theoriques-des-lignes-m-covoit-ligne-plus?locale=en) , [Covoit\u2019ici](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/lignes-de-covoiturage-covoitici-plaine-de-lain/)\r\n\r\nThe Google Extended GTFS Route Types Extension ([link](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/extended-route-types)), or something similar, could let us describe carpooling lines with the required level of detail.\r\nIt is interesting to note that OpenTripPlanner uses the `route_type` values between 1551 and 1560 for the carpooling. ([Github](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/4641),  [documentation](https://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/dev-2.x/RoutingModes/))\r\nBut ideally, we would prefer to avoid requiring an extension for this : if we can use \u201cstock GTFS\u201d directly for that, it would be better for everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter some searches, the carpooling subject are already mentioned on this discussion : https://groups.google.com/g/gtfs-changes/c/keT5rTPS7Y0/m/aPg9n-NiAAAJ\r\n\r\nThe GTFS-OnDemand (GOFS) project suggests adding the value 13-car in `route_type` enumeration ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UJ21xWRzbG7Z3Xl-cpoYGoTmhRQv73XbttDoZ8bhGD8/edit#heading=h.o6hvogf71gft)).\r\n\r\nRelevant issues/PR :\r\n\r\n- #174  \u2192 add route_type values to GTFS (merged)\r\n- #310  \u2192 add route_type values \r\n- #358  \u2192 route_type at trips.txt level (trip desc)\r\n- #413  \u2192 governance\r\n\r\n\r\n# Proposed solution\r\n\r\n### 1- routes.txt - route_type\r\nWould it be possible to integrate a plage of `route_type` values, like OTP reserved 1551-1560? This will permit to have the right granularity of different types of carpooling lines.\r\n\r\nOr even specify more precisely:\r\n\r\n- 1551 - Carpooling line (group)\r\n  - 1552 - Carpooling line with application and with departure guarantee\r\n  - 1553 - Carpooling line with application and without departure guarantee\r\n  - 1554 - Carpooling line without application (spontaneous)\r\n\r\nWhile working on this, we are wondering if the route_type used this way isn\u2019t maybe becoming a \u201cleaky abstraction\u201d ; if we were to describe the service with only one route_type (eg. 13 - car), then the modelisation of the reality would not be accurate enough to fulfil the needs of our users.\r\n### 2- trips.txt - trip_desc\r\nLike done in [routes.txt](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#routestxt) and [stops.txt](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#stopstxt), we propose to add a column description `trip_desc` in _trips.txt_, to provide information for the final user about specificities of the trip.\r\n\r\nThis new column will be used, in case of carpooling lines, to add information about the departure guarantee, the necessity of using an application or not, etc. \r\n\r\nWe do realize the limitations of using such non-structured fields (e.g. problems when interpreting the \u201cdata\u201d, translating etc), but it feels good enough for our needs.\r\n\r\n# Where do we go from here?\r\nCarpooling has been a national government priority in France since December 2022. Currently, France has 68 carpooling lines in operation, and 72 lines new lines are planned at the moment.\r\n\r\nWe would love to be able to leverage the GTFS specification (already largely in use) to also cover the carpooling to the extent of details that is required for our user base.\r\n\r\nWe hope that this issue will lead to interesting discussions & evolutions!",

    "body": "### Describe the problem\n\nWe have received multiple messages from agencies confused by an error (`stop_without_zone_id`) found in validation reports forwarded to them by the National Transit Database. I've investigated the error and am wondering if the way the spec handles `zone_id` requirements should be clarified, and if so, whether such a clarification would break backwards compatibility. I'm not sure, because it is a *conditional* requirement, and adding the exception I propose below would be easing a restriction, not adding a new one.\r\n\r\nThe current requirement is essentially: If fare_rules.txt contains records, then presence of `zone_id` is required for **all** stops in the dataset.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are cases where you could define a fare_rule without the use of `zone_id`s, for example, with route-based fares. In my opinion, a feed should still be valid with partial `zone_id` presence IF those stops without a `zone_id` are present in stop_times records with a `trip_id` whose `route_id` is present in a fare_rules.txt record with only `fare_id` and `route_id` defined.\n\n### Use cases\n\nConsider the following example\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n**fare_rules.txt**\r\n\r\nfare_id | route_id | origin_id | destination_id\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\n1855 | | A | B\r\n7549 | 50 | \u00a0 | \u00a0\r\n\r\n**stops.txt**\r\n\r\nstop_id | ... | zone_id\r\n-- | -- | --\r\n111 | ... | \r\n222 | ... | A\r\n333 | ... | A\r\n444 | ... | A\r\n555 | ... | B\r\n666 | ... | B\r\n\r\nGiven that `stop_id=111` is present only in `route_id=50` trips, you can determine that any itinerary that includes the stop will have a fare of `fare_id=7549` since it belongs to route_id=50. Giving the stop a `zone_id` would be superfluous because there is no fare rule that zone would belong to.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIs it possible to modify the conditional requirement, adding the following exception to the rule?\r\n\r\n\"**Required** if providing fare information using fare_rules.txt, *unless stop is present only in stop_times.txt records with a `trip_id` whose `route_id` is present in a fare_rules.txt record with only `fare_id` and `route_id` defined.*\"\r\n\r\nIdeally written in a less confusing way \ud83d\ude05\n\n### Additional information\n\nI have attached an example dataset you can run through the validator to see the `stop_without_zone_id` error in question.\r\n\r\n[stop_without_zone_id_feedTEST.zip](https://github.com/google/transit/files/14091464/stop_without_zone_id_feedTEST.zip)\r\n\r\nYou will find several stops without `zone_id`s accounted for by route-based fares that trigger the error.\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge, feeds containing the `stop_without_zone_id` due to this reason have passed validation of consumers like Google.",

For example, in a journey with four legs (Leg1 \u2192 Leg2 \u2192 Leg3 \u2192 Leg4), where Leg1 and Leg4 belong to SystemA, and Leg2 and Leg3 belong to SystemB. In SystemA, even if riders travel through a different system(B) during the journey, Leg4 can still acquire a discount from Leg1, as long as it remains within a specific amount of time. However, the current Fares v2 spec seems unable to differentiate whether non-direct transfers are allowed.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the current spec also appears unable to distinguish cases where the `transfer_count`and the timer for `duration_limit` should be \"reset\". For instance, in the example above, when transferring to Leg2, it might be necessary to \"reset\" the timer and `transfer_count` for SystemB.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nWe'd love to see any potential solutions and real-world use cases. Please feel free to share any thoughts here.",

The current file description of `fare_products.txt` is:\r\n> To describe the different types of tickets or fares that `can be purchased by riders`.\r\n\r\nHowever, some fare products represent virtual products that can't be purchased (by themselves) by riders, such as a transfer cost.\r\n\r\n2. Although the current primary key [`fare_product_id`, `fare_media_id`] already implies multiple records can have the same `fare_product_id`, it's unclear in the description that several Fare Products can be grouped under the same `fare_product_id`. (As mentioned/suggested in [issue#367](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/367))\r\n\r\n3. There might be confusion on whether records with the same `fare_product_id` can have different prices.\r\n(At the November meeting, the working group agreed that the same `fare_product_id` can have different prices)\r\n\r\n### Changes in this PR:\r\nAdd clarification text to `fare_products.txt`\r\n\r\nSince this is just a clarification, I propose we don't have to go through the voting process.",

Clipper card).\r\n\r\nWe need a producer and a consumer to be able to adopt this in GTFS. If you are either and you're interested in supporting this, please comment on this issue or write us at specification@mobilitydata.org. \n\n### Additional information\n\nFirst GH issue opened with the new template \ud83c\udfc4, this is great!",

    "body": "In this PR, some small editorial changes.\r\n\r\n1. Make all references to other files consistent. \r\nCurrently, the references to other files are mostly either (1) the the file name with a link to the file and no code formatting (e. g. [fare_leg_rules.txt](fare_leg_rules.txt)), or (2) file name with code formatting and no link (e. g. `fare_leg_rules.txt`). Given that (1) is more common though the spec document, I modified all (2) to (1).\r\n\r\n2. A change to the [`stops.stop_timezone`](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#stopstxt) description to better articulate the information written. The current description implies that the presence of `stops.stop_timezone` affects how values should be entered in stop_times.txt, which is false.\r\n\r\nCurrent:\r\n> If stop_timezone values are provided, the times in [stop_times.txt](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#stop_timetxt) should be entered as the time since midnight in the timezone specified by agency.agency_timezone.\r\n\r\nProposed: \r\n\r\n> The times provided in [`stop_times.txt`](#stop_timestxt) are in the timezone specified by `agency.agency_timezone`, not `stop_timezone`.\r\n\r\n3. Added the Dataset Publishing Guidelines that have been added recently in the index at the top of the doc and fixed a link in them.\r\n\r\n4. Change the description of `calendar.service_id` to remove that the ID must be unique. Now that we have a `Unique ID` field type, these mentions are not needed, and `calendar_service_id` is the only field in GTFS that still has it.",

    "body": "### TL;DR\r\n\r\n- As GTFS Best Practices (BP) are being migrated to the specification, a number of outstanding Issues and PRs proposing changes to the Best Practices still exist and remain unresolved. \r\n- MobilityData has carried out an initial evaluation of the status for each item and prepared a summary of all of these proposed changes.\r\n- With this issue, we\u2019re hoping to bring visibility to these outstanding issues and to restart the discussion around them, so that any improvement that the community finds valuable could be carried forward.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\n- MobilityData has initiated a process to merge GTFS best practices into the official spec. This is intended to bring more visibility and adoption to existing and future best practices, based on [feedback from the community](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/375). \r\n- As of December 2023, multiple portions of the GTFS Schedule Best Practices have been successfully incorporated into the spec\u2019s reference document with more coming soon as outlined in this [phasing plan](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/396). \r\n- Simultaneously, once adopted in the specification, every best practice transferred is removed from the Best Practices thus the Best Practices repositories ([Schedule](https://github.com/MobilityData/GTFS_Schedule_Best-Practices) and [Real Time](https://github.com/MobilityData/GTFS_Realtime_Best-Practices)) will eventually be deprecated. \r\n- We suggest that discussions for changes to existing best practices or new ones take place in the google/transit repository. This change has already been implemented since earlier this year, with a notice redirecting community members to suggest changes for BP directly in the google/transit repo. \r\n- Currently, there are several open Best Practices Issues and PRs both for Schedule and Real Time. The purpose of this issue is to transfer these outstanding items into the google/transit repository.\r\n\r\n### Outstanding Best Practices issues & PRs\r\n\r\n#### **Real Time**\r\n\r\n| **Item**                                                           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                   | **Still relevant?** | **Status**                                                                                         | **Priority** |\r\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\r\n| [Best Practices suggestions #2](https://github.com/MobilityData/GTFS_Realtime_Best-Practices/issues/2)                                      | Include Route_id in trip update, vehicle position and alert feeds.

longer relevant, either because they will be (or already are) addressed with the migration of BP into the spec, or due to their presence at both the issue and PR stages (thus keeping only the PR as still relevant). The 6 issues deemed not relevant are listed below.\r\n  - [Real Time] - [Add link to GTFS Resource and GTFS Realtime Specification #9 ](https://github.com/MobilityData/GTFS_Realtime_Best-Practices/issues/9)\r\n  - [Real Time] - [Increase navigability by adding links within about.md #10 ](https://github.com/MobilityData/GTFS_Realtime_Best-Practices/issues/10)\r\n  - [Real Time] - [[Formatting] Consolidate Best Practices into single legible document #18 ](https://github.com/MobilityData/GTFS_Realtime_Best-Practices/issues/18)\r\n  - [Real Time] - [Re-organize to add webpage rendering + nest files #20 ](https://github.com/MobilityData/GTFS_Realtime_Best-Practices/pull/20)\r\n  - [Schedule] - [Proposed best practice: shapes.txt should be included #37](https://github.com/MobilityData/GTFS_Schedule_Best-Practices/issues/37)\r\n  - [Schedule] - [Versioning cadence #41](https://github.com/MobilityData/GTFS_Schedule_Best-Practices/issues/41) \r\n\r\n### Expected next steps\r\n\r\n- MobilityData will post a message referencing this issue and the migration process in each of these outstanding Issues and PRs and then close them. They will remain visible to the community for reference.\r\n- Acknowledging that addressing all these issues requires extensive community discussions, MobilityData will gradually work towards resolution, prioritizing based on needs.\r\n- Community members are welcome to carry some of these issues forward  by opening an issue or a PR on this repo. MobilityData will support any initiatives by helping to manage the discussions and provide technical support when needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in previous issues dealing with this migration, MobilityData recognizes that this is a big effort that requires a great deal of community support and discussion, thus we welcome all contributions and we\u2019re more than happy to provide our support to the community to move this forward.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "### **Use Case**\r\n\r\n1. When riders transfer between multiple legs during their journey using fare products, there are typically two scenarios:\r\n\r\n- In the case of a \"ticket-based system\" (i.e., a product similar to a pass), special transfer rules between two legs (such as free transfers) must be applied using the same fare product.\r\n- In a \"stored-value system\" (i.e., a general pay-as-you-go product), special transfer rules between two legs do not require the use of the same fare product.\r\n\r\n2. Most transfer rules between two legs necessitate the use of the same fare media to apply, but there are exceptions. For instance, within a region, two networks might exist where one has introduced an app media while the other only uses paper tickets. In such cases, transfer rules might apply between two distinct fare media (for example, showing a paper ticket to the driver to get a free transfer).\r\n\r\n### **Problem to solve**\r\nThe current Fares v2 spec does not have mechanism for differentiating the above use cases or provide explanation within its description, leading to potential ambiguity. This is especially relevant for certain transit systems, such as STM, that operate 100% with a ticket-based system. Transit firstly posed the question, \"[Should fare transfers require that the same fare product is used on both legs?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zF5i03BFQi1kVBfN17aR7N1KRrpsHs3B9YjCzE8apJE/edit#heading=h.9a66f7frd08b)\" Subsequently, Google also raised the following questions in this [transfer semantics document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lqh3eI2YoxAaLSqUePCkcQ7WmyD-d-eXeDYymPnUfLQ/edit#heading=h.swddidrlwbq1) [_this issue only discusses the first three questions in this document_]:\r\n- For a leg-to-leg transfer to match a row in `fare_transfer_rules.txt`, is it required that both legs have the same fare media type?\r\n- Is it intended that multiple rows in `fare_transfer_rules.txt` can match a single leg-to-leg transfer?\r\n\r\n### **Proposed solution**\r\nOn October 24th, the working group reached a consensus to clarify these questions, leaning towards a default behavior mechanism to minimize any potential breaking changes. Based on this consensus, we drafted [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18e1XGgp5vMO2R-wIIk3nnZea-Ol5e9UaWkeebi3ijI8/edit#heading=h.hh2l9k6b2on9) that aims to resolve the above 3 questions.\r\n\r\nIn the November discussion, the working group is currently leaning towards option 1 proposed, which involves adding `fare_product_behavior`, `fare_media_behavior`, and `filter_fare_product_id` to `fare_transfer_rules`. This option is favored as this mechanism appears to be more like the attributes of `fare_transfer_rules `(with option 2 being an alternative).\r\n\r\nWe'd love to see any feedback on this proposal or any related use cases. Please feel free to share any thoughts on this issue.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "### **Context**\r\nThe `rule_priority` field is originally derived from Ito World's [\"override\" proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q7mo2k4j1-uEmaLYIQVoNqdR2a_xMj9Kc-iA9mGwnXo/edit#heading=h.4bej6s69xndk), it is used to simply represent cases when some matching rules need to take precedence over other matching rules.\r\n\r\nDuring the discussion of the `rule_priority` proposal, the working group identified issues regarding backward compatibility and how to align with the existing empty semantics(\u201canything except\u2026\u201d) of `network_id`, `from_area_id`, and `to_area_id`. In the meeting on August 22nd, the working group reached a consensus on the need for a rule_priority field and the mechanism for changing empty semantics. It was agreed that this mechanism should not cause breaking changes for feed producers. After this discussion, we have also drafted this [spec modeling proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LWlV5JUraV0altwg56Cxd5o_-BIAaO7g3TKqvBtgffA/edit).\r\n\r\nIn the meeting on September 26th, there was agreement on moving forward with Option 1 in the spec modeling proposal for changing empty semantics (`rule_priority` field existence as a trigger)\r\n\r\n### **Changes in this PR**\r\n- Add `rule_priority` field in `fare_leg_rules.txt`\r\n- Modify `fare_leg_rules` file description to indicate the difference between `rule_priority` and existing empty semantics\r\n- Modify `fare_leg_rules.network_id`, `fare_leg_rules.from_area_id`, `fare_leg_rules.to_area_id` field description to indicate the difference between `rule_priority` and existing empty semantics\r\n\r\n**This PR uses the existence of the `rule_priority` field as a trigger to change existing empty semantics.**\r\n\r\n### **What is not included in this PR**\r\n- `scope` or `rule_priority_scope` field\r\n- `rule_priority` in `fare_transfer_rules.txt`\r\n\r\nThe working group agrees that we can consider introducing `rule_priority` for `fare_transfer_rules` after gaining a better understanding of the mechanism behind `fare_transfer_rules`.\r\n\r\n### **Validator rule**\r\nWe noticed that producers might directly include field headers (without any values), but failed to realize this could pose in altering the existing empty semantics. Therefore, the description of `rule_priority` included the sentence \"If the rule_priority field exists, it should not have all records entirely empty.\" When the `rule_priority` field exists, but all records across the files are empty, the validator will trigger a warning.\r\n\r\nFor previous discussions, please see [issue#383](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/383) and [working group meeting minutes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d3g5bMXupdElCKrdv6rhFNN11mrQgEk-ibA7wdqVLTU/edit#heading=h.hmvo53ak6eh6).\r\n\r\nPlease go through the changes and feel free to share your thoughts/questions here.",

    "body": "GTFS is unusual in that the specification describes a file format, and presents itself as a file format, without any direct description of the entity-relationship model that the file format encodes. Most proposed changes seem to involve long discussions about the serialized interchange format of this data model, rather than the data model itself, which is never pictured or formally described. \r\n\r\nWould it be beneficial if the definitive point of reference in the GTFS spec, GTFS-RT spec, and all proposed extensions was a formal data model, with the serialization format and documentation following from the model, not the other way around?\r\n\r\nDiscussions might be much simpler if everyone was just looking at the same entity-relationship diagram. I suspect problems and inconsistencies would stand out more clearly and alternatives would be easier to communicate.\r\n\r\nFor years it has been a staple of research papers and guides making use of open transit data to reverse-engineer the entity-relationship model from the textual descriptions in the spec. For example:\r\n- https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-GTFS-Schema-for-the-data-from-JSP-Skopje_fig1_263853949\r\n- https://www.trafiklab.se/docs/using-trafiklab-data/using-gtfs-files/static-gtfs-files/\r\n- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844020305740\r\n- https://ipeagit.github.io/intro_access_book/4_dados_gtfs.en.html\r\n\r\nTo me it is really odd that the data model of GTFS is left as an exercise for the reader, which has to be rediscovered and shared over and over (as a topic of scientific research), while it would be the definitive core of many other specifications.\r\n\r\nRather than a purely visual vector drawing, I would expect the data model to be expressed in a formal language, allowing it to be validated and automatically turned into a class diagram, interactively in response to edits. Almost as a convenient side effect, this should allow automatically generating a source code skeleton in any number of languages.\r\n\r\nI know some people are cringing at the thought of UML and all the Enterprise Ceremony around it. I am not specifically talking about UML, just anything that gets the job done and is pleasant to work with, and is structured and line-oriented enough for effective diffing and version control.\r\n\r\nHere's one of the more promising examples I've identified:\r\nhttps://github.com/holistics/dbml/\r\n\r\nThis is used by:\r\nhttps://dbml.dbdiagram.io\r\nhttps://dbdocs.io\r\n\r\nAnd here is the full DBML syntax:\r\nhttps://dbml.dbdiagram.io/docs\r\n\r\nHere is a quick sketch data model of a subset of GTFS-static (just an example, probably contains mistakes): https://dbdiagram.io/d/GTFS-Scheduled-Core-6576ceab56d8064ca0c69140\r\n\r\nAnd an image of the live rendered model diagram:\r\n<img width=\"1568\" alt=\"DBML-GTFS-Core\" src=\"https://github.com/google/transit/assets/112871/eb24c0f5-bc0b-49f8-9cc5-a38519ed3e0e\">\r\n\r\nNote how the implicit \"service\" entity is rendered in the diagram, even though it's not materialized in GTFS feeds. This kind of implicit entities are something that seems to be causing confusion in recent change proposals and having them represented in the spec could make it much easier to communicate.\r\n\r\nAnd the resulting published docs: https://dbdocs.io/abyrd/GTFS-Scheduled-Core?table=stop_times&schema=public&view=table_structure\r\n\r\nAnd the source code used in the above sketch model:\r\n```DBML\r\nTable stops {\r\n  stop_id id [pk]\r\n  stop_name string [null]\r\n  stop_lat float [not null, note: 'range -90 to 90']\r\n  stop_lon float [not null, note: 'range -180 to 180']\r\n}\r\n\r\nTable routes {\r\n  route_id id [pk]\r\n  route_name string [not null]\r\n}\r\n\r\nTable trips {\r\n  trip_id id [pk]\r\n  route_id id [ref: > routes.route_id]\r\n  service_id string [ref: > services.service_id]\r\n}\r\n\r\nTable stop_times {\r\n  trip_id id [ref: > trips.trip_id]\r\n  stop_sequence integer\r\n  stop_id id [ref: > stops.stop_id]\r\n  arrival_time hhmmss [note: '''\r\n    Conditionally Required:\r\n    - Required for first and last stop in a trip\r\n    - Required for timepoint=1\r\n    - Optional otherwise\r\n    ''']\r\n  departure_time hhmmss\r\n  pickup_type pick_drop [null, default: 0]\r\n  drop_off_type pick_drop [null, default: 0]\r\n  indexes {\r\n    (trip_id, stop_sequence) [pk]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nTable services [note: \"elided table\"] {\r\n  service_id id [pk]\r\n}\r\n\r\nTable calendar {\r\n  service_id id [ref: - services.service_id]\r\n  \"monday-sunday\" bool\r\n  start_date integer [note: 'Format YYYYMMDD']\r\n  end_date integer [note: 'Format YYYYMMDD']\r\n}\r\n\r\nenum pick_drop {\r\n  0 [note: \"Regularly scheduled\"]\r\n  1 [note: \"No pickup available\"]\r\n  2 [note: \"Phone agency\"]\r\n  3 [note: \"Coordinate with driver\"]\r\n}\r\n\r\nTable calendar_dates {\r\n  service_id id [ref: > services.service_id]\r\n  date date\r\n  exception_type integer [\r\n    note: '''\r\n      1 = added\r\n      2 = removed\r\n    ''']\r\n}\r\n```",

    "body": "The French regional railways [TER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_express_r%C3%A9gional) operates both trains and buses on regular routes all over the country. They do publish a GTFS dataset daily: [https://eu.ftp.opendatasoft.com/sncf/gtfs/export-ter-gtfs-last.zip](https://eu.ftp.opendatasoft.com/sncf/gtfs/export-ter-gtfs-last.zip)\r\n\r\nSome routes are designed to be operated with both trains and buses depending on the trip. You can download a human readable (PDF) schedule for such a route [here](https://ter-fiches-horaires.sncf.fr/publish/A19%20et%20cars%20Colmar%20Metzeral%20%28du%2021%20ao%C3%83%C2%83%C3%82%C2%BBt%20au%209%20d%C3%83%C2%83%C3%82%C2%A9cembre%202023%29%20MAJ%201008.pdf) (fr).\r\nOn the schedule table of the first page, the `12:44`, `20:28` and `22:00` trips are clearly identified with a blue bus icon (![image](https://github.com/google/transit/assets/63465740/622e59fd-f76e-48f8-bbae-9e0ce588b7bf)) which is defined in the legend as regular trip carried out with bus. I insist, those are not exceptions (that could be handled through GTFS-RT).\r\n\r\nIn the current GTFS specification, the \"type of transportation\" is a `routes` attribute and as such, cannot *elegantly* handle such use case.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\nThere are few ways around this (that I can think about) but none of them are without drawback (technically or semantically).\r\n\r\n1. **Route duplication**: create one route regrouping the \"train trips\" and one route the \"bus trips\". Somehow it is kind of what they are doing in the PDF version of their schedules. If you scroll down to the last pages you will notice that after the general \"Route 19\" schedule there is a specific section for a \"Route 119\" that only shows bus trips.\r\nThey do that to precisely explain to the user where the bus stops are relative to the train station. Usually very close (few meters) but sometimes a bit further.\r\nHowever they still chose to include the bus trips in the general schedule of \"Route 19\" because semantically **it is the same route** and people might not bother scrolling down few pages to find the additional trips.\r\n\r\n2. **Loose use of `routes.route_type` (breaking the specs)**: that's actually what they implement in their GTFS dataset. That particular route is marked with a `2 / Rail` value (because it is mostly carried out by trains I suppose) but they do encode the actual type of transportation within their `stops.ID` pattern. For instance, at the same station, they'd have a `StopPoint:OCETrain TER-87182394` stop and a `StopPoint:OCECar TER-87182394` stop. Then, as a GTFS consumer, one can infer the type of transportation by checking that all stops along the trip are `*OCETrain*` or `*OCECar*` (*car* means bus in French).\r\n_Note:_ Although technically, having to read the whole stops sequence to infer transportation type is not ideal, I find it very interesting and somehow legitimate for the type of transportation to be a `stops | location_type=0` attribute actually: after all, \"train stops\" and \"bus stops\" are very commonly distinguishable entities from the *real world*.\r\n\r\n## Suggestions for modification of the specs\r\n* Implement a way to *relate* routes together, so in this example the \"route duplication\" workaround could be addressed properly.\r\n* Implement type of transportation overriding scheme at `trips` level (see #358) or at `stops` level as in the second workaround. Such a overriding would mean to specify the `routes.route_type` to be a **default value**  and/or to add a \"Mixed\" value to the enum and handle the necessary conditional requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "**User Story**\r\n\r\nAs a consumer of hundreds of different GTFS feeds,\r\nI would like to avoid having to update our database of which URL to download a transit agency's feeds from,\r\nSo that I can consistently download each transit agency's most up-to-date data even if they change their internal GTFS publishing process.\r\n\r\n**Description of Problem**\r\n\r\nWe have had a significant amount of problems downloading current data from transit agencies due to them changing the URL(s) from which to download their GTFS data. In a number of cases, we have failed to discover out-of-date feeds sometimes for months. Transit agencies can and frequently do change vendors that publish their GTFS data and when that happens, they often will have new URLs that come with the new vendors. Sometimes, the transit agencies may update their \"GTFS Page\" showing a list of URLs, but it should not be necessary for consumers to monitor such pages for changes and it may be difficult to automate such a process to check for this anyways.\r\n\r\n**Proposal**\r\n\r\nI propose to add additional language to the best practices/specification that says that a public transit operator should publish their permalinks to GTFS data on the same domain as their own website and not be exclusively using a vendor's website domain. In following this practice, transit agencies should update their permalinks to redirect to whichever URL is currently serving the most up-to-date version of their GTFS data.",

This represents the second phase of the merging of Best Practices into the GTFS specification as outlined in issue #396.\r\n\r\nThe incorporation of [Dataset Publishing & General Practice guidelines](https://gtfs.org/schedule/best-practices/#dataset-publishing-general-practices) would include an update of the text linking to the Google transitfeed tool merge function, so it references a list of merge tools instead. This content is proposed to be inserted in the reference document as a separate section before the current Field Definitions section to provide greater visibility to this information. Regarding the [Practice Recommendations for all files](https://gtfs.org/schedule/best-practices/#all-files), this content would be incorporated under the File Requirements section matching its bullet point format. \r\n\r\nFor both sections, minor editorial changes have been made to conform to RFC 2119 without affecting the severity of any statements (as recommendations, they would all remain as SHOULD statements). \r\n\r\nAs this change focuses only on moving the Best Practices content in its current status into spec, It is suggested that any potential revisions and improvements for these best practices should be discussed in a separate conversation if there's interest in doing so, ideally after being merged into the specification.\r\n",

However, during the fares v2 working group discussions, we identified the need to separate the production of fares data. The `networks.txt` and `route_networks.txt` stem from [Ito World's proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/182X7Ex31wjIqnWbG8DU_lNvvuQjeWjV1ch7RzbuIBqg/edit#heading=h.p4ax53hfetiq), using a mechanism similar to `areas.txt` and `stop.areas.txt`, allowing fares data to be produced separately from schedule data.\r\n\r\n### Changes in this PR\r\n- Add `networks.txt` and `route_networks.txt` files\r\n- Modify presence of `routes.network_id` \r\n- Modify description of `fare_leg_rules.network_id`\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to capture consensus reached during the working group meetings:\r\n- Adding these two files\r\n- Not allowing both `routes.network_id` and `routes_networks.txt` + `networks.txt` in the same dataset. (presence: Conditionally Forbidden)\r\n- Not allowing many-to-many relationship (A route can be defined in 1 network). We can release this restriction if needed in the future.\r\n\r\nIn addition, `networks.txt` indicates networks are used for fares use case, we can release this restriction if needed in the future as well.\r\n\r\nFor previous discussions, please see [issue#389](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/389) and [working group meeting minutes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d3g5bMXupdElCKrdv6rhFNN11mrQgEk-ibA7wdqVLTU/edit#heading=h.hmvo53ak6eh6).\r\n\r\nPlease go through the changes and feel free to share your thoughts/questions here.",

Trip-Modifications is mainly used in a detour use case. \r\n\r\nToday, we're [launching the detour feature](https://blog.transitapp.com/how-transit-and-swiftly-put-bus-detours-on-the-map/) in Transit for more agencies with Trip Modifications produced by [Swiftly](https://www.goswift.ly/blog/how-swiftly-and-transit-put-bus-detours-on-the-map)! Now that there is one producer and one consumer, the current PR is not an experimental field and actually removes the experimental tag for `Shape`, which has been in the [spec for 2 years](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/272).  \r\n\r\nFeel free to ask questions, or give feedback!\r\n\r\n**Edit: see example feeds [here](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/403#issuecomment-1758197145).** \r\n**Latest changes before a potential experimental vote are up**\r\n\r\nExample of the feature in practice: \r\n![Swiftly_Detours-screens-4 png](https://github.com/TransitApp/transit/assets/129745/4dcad240-a6eb-4ed2-a628-3a2767d1cf13)",

We will ask participants to identify pain points within the formal process as highlighted in [changes.md](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/CHANGES.md) as well as other informal processes that occur. We will then ask the participants to prioritize the pain points and to provide a solution for a single pain point of their choosing. \r\n\r\n\ud83e\udd14 Here are some of the topics that might come up: \r\n\r\n- Versioning\r\n- Voting\r\n- Implementation\r\n- Testing\r\n- Consumer / Producer proof during testing\r\n- Official Platforms to publish - Should they be mentioned in the process?\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udce2 Our ask to the community members (you) that won't be able to attend would be to share with us some of their pain points that they would like to highlight for participants to solve. We will be doing something similar in October for the [NYC workshops](https://mobilitydata.org/2023-mobilitydata-north-american-workshop/) with the goal to open a PR/issue with the proposed solutions. \r\n\r\n\u2139\ufe0f A pain point can be a process or an item that is missing, too complex, incomplete, too vague, \u2026 \r\n\r\n\ud83d\ude4f Please provide your pain point using this template:\r\n\r\n> Name:\r\n> Organization:\r\n> Producer or Consumer:\r\n> Pain point description: \r\n> What element of changes.md would it affect: \r\n\r\n\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0f We will be sharing the solutions of the workshops so that you can comment and be kept in the loop. No specification level decisions will be made during the workshops. \r\n",

Here is the summarized context, for details please see the [proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EeHaY5S0rDLFMdXQ6OrF_-0R7-r_8vBMSAkCdQVAtyw/edit#heading=h.2uewgmrw3fdf).\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\nThe existing empty matching semantics allow producers to specify a fare rule for a particular matching predicate and then specify a rule that matches all other possible values without having to specify all of them explicitly. `fare_leg_rules.network_id` as an example:\r\n> If there are no matching `fare_leg_rules.network_id` values to the `network_id` being filtered, empty `fare_leg_rules.network_id` will be matched by default.\r\nAn empty entry in `fare_leg_rules.network_id` corresponds to all networks defined in `routes.txt` excluding the ones listed under `fare_leg_rules.network_id`\r\n\r\nHowever, since empty value semantics apply to the entire `fare_leg_rules` file, sometimes producers need to \"repetitively\" specify exhaustive networks/combinations of areas to avoid unintended exclusion based on existing empty semantics in `fare_leg_rules.txt` \r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\nAdd `fare_leg_rules.scope` field to provide a mechanism to limit the scope of empty-value matching semantics.\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\"><b style=\"font-weight:normal;\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-023186d6-7fff-42a9-d25a-e4fe8aac0977\"><div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:176.25pt;\" align=\"left\">\r\n\r\nField Name | Type | Presence | Description\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nscope | ID | Optional | An identifier that indicates the evaluation scope of the rule relative to other rules.\u00a0 For a rule using empty-value matching semantics, excluded values should only be considered for rules with the same scope value.\u00a0 An empty or unspecified value indicates the \u201cdefault\u201d scope, where a rule in the \u201cdefault\u201d scope will only be evaluated against other rules in the \u201cdefault\u201d scope.\r\n\r\n</div></b>\r\n\r\n### Example usage\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\"><b style=\"font-weight:normal;\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-98187a46-7fff-2208-7d49-413be5499877\"><div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:166.5pt;\" align=\"left\">\r\n\r\nscope | network_id | from_area_id | to_area_id | fare_product_id\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nsubway | subway | z1 | z1 | subway_z1_fare\r\nsubway | subway | z1 | z2 | subway_z12_fare\r\nbus | bus | \u00a0 | \u00a0 | bus_fare\r\n\r\n</div></b>\r\n\r\nSince \"bus\" scope is different from \"subway\" scope, The empty `from_area_id` and `to_area_id` for \"bus\" scope will **NOT** exclude `from_area_id` and `to_area_id` defined in \"subway\" scope (i.e. zone1 - zone1 & zone1 - zone2). The \u201cbus\u201d rules will now match all zones. \r\n\r\n### Open questions\r\n- Should \u201cscope\u201d be in the primary key for `fare_leg_rules.txt`?\r\n- What are the implications for the `rule_priority` proposal for fare leg rules?\r\n\r\nPlease share any thoughts on `fare_leg_rules.scope` in this issue.",

They have proposed the alternative of including MultiPoints as a possible locations.geojson feature to describe collections of stops.\r\n\r\nAre there any concerns with such a change? Questions I have are:\r\n1. Is a MultiPoint feature containing information duplicative of a stop(s) in stops.txt problematic (i.e., a stop may be described in two different places, but with a different primary key)?\r\n2. If a MultiPoint feature referred to geolocations already referenced in stops.txt, would that cause complications with consumers parsing which trips to return?\r\n3. If question 1 or 2 is the case, is there some needed id relationship to stops.txt, akin to what @e-lo has brought up in past conversations?\r\n4. Is cataloguing points/stops in a file format other than .csv opening pandoras box [even more](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/391)?\r\n\r\nThe two other use cases for including areas.txt/stop_areas.txt in Flex data are discussed in [this issue](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/397); there I posit that these can be covered without areas.txt/stop_areas.txt.",

This can be described either with a MultiPolygon that contains all the zones:\r\n- trip1: from Multi_Zone (pickup 8:00-17:00\u2026) to Multi_Zone (drop-off 8:00-17:00\u2026)\r\n- trip2: from Multi_Zone (pickup 8:00-17:00\u2026) to Multi_Zone (drop-off 8:00-17:00\u2026)\r\n\r\nor by describing each scenario with multiple trips for each specific town, like the example above:\r\n- trip1: from ZoneA (pickup 8:00-17:00\u2026) to ZoneA (drop-off 8:00-17:00\u2026)\r\n- trip2: from ZoneA (pickup 8:00-17:00\u2026) to ZoneB (drop-off 8:00-17:00\u2026)\r\n- trip3: from ZoneB (pickup 8:00-17:00\u2026) to ZoneB (drop-off 8:00-17:00\u2026)\r\n- trip4: from ZoneB (pickup 8:00-17:00\u2026) to Zone A (drop-off 8:00-17:00\u2026)\r\n\r\n**Given that these use cases can be covered without the use of areas/stop_areas, should we remove the ability to reference a polygon/multipolygon location.geojson `id` in stop_areas.txt?**\r\n\r\nNow before we say \"why not just remove the inclusion of areas.txt/stop_areas.txt in Flex altogether?\",  **there is actually a third use case that would still require a solution**: Completely on-demand stops, or \"point deviation\"\u2013routes with a collection of stops as the service area that a rider can be picked up/dropped off at in any order within a timeframe. This is currently covered with a `stop_times.stop_id` referencing an `area_id` containing multiple stops. I've posted another issue [here](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/398) to discuss this topic specifically, as the possible need for an alternative solution has recently been brought up and could have implications for the wider Flex architecture.",

Must be in the same units used in [shapes.txt](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#shapestxt).\r\n\r\nWe've observed cases where a `stop_times.shapes_dist_traveled` is specified for trips that don't have a shape associated (no `shape_id` for the `trip_id` referenced in `stop_times.txt`). \r\n\r\ntrips.txt\r\n| route_id | service_id | trip_id | shape_id |\r\n|----------|------------|---------|----------|\r\n| route_a  | regular    | trip_1  |          |\r\n| route_a  | regular    | trip_2  |          |\r\n| route_a  | regular    | trip_3  |          |\r\n\r\nstop_times.txt\r\n| trip_id | stop_id | stop_sequence | shape_dist_traveled |\r\n|---------|---------|---------------|---------------------|\r\n| trip_1  | stop_3  | 3             | 0                   |\r\n| trip_1  | stop_4  | 4             | 298                 |\r\n| trip_1  | stop_5  | 5             | 1029                |\r\n\r\nAlthough this doesn't break anything, it seems like it's never intentional, and could potentially mean that a shape was intended to be associated. \r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\nWe would like to amend the specification with a \"should\" statement and add a check in the [Canonical GTFS Schedule Validator](https://gtfs-validator.mobilitydata.org/) with a WARNING severity level.\r\n\r\nThe new statement could look like this:\r\n\r\n> `shape_dist_traveled` should not be specified if the `trip_id` value does not have a `shape_id` defined in `trips.txt`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions we'd like the community's input on before proposing a spec amendment\r\n- Are we in agreement that this should be flagged as a WARNING?\r\n- Do we also need`shapes.shape_dist_traveled` to be defined to make use of `stop_times.shape_distance_traveled`?",

Here are some options:\r\n1. Create an extra field to allow for the international extension. This can cause some friction as not all formats work in the same way. Some examples: \r\n    - In NA, it would be +1 (XXX)-XXX-XXXX where no numbers are dropped\r\n    - In EU, it would be +XX (0)XX XXX XX XX where 0 is dropped when using +XX\r\n2. Recommended usage of an international format with option to keep local format.\r\n3. (Restricting the use of local format and allowing only the international format.) This would not be backward compatible.\r\n\r\nHere is a [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_conventions_for_writing_telephone_numbers) for more information on the international format.",

In the past these kind of discussions (think zeromq, mqtt, websockets...) were explicitly _avoided_ in favor of _proven technology_. With the suggestion for a new serialisation format for GTFS-Flex namely: GeoJSON this feels to me as \"too fast\" especially because we historically have had this discussion about shapes.txt. But also more recently how to serialise more complex structures where CSV (honestly) also does not make sense either.\r\n\r\nNo, I am not proposing a full overhaul of all the files (or suggesting a well thought out format as NeTEx ;). But I think we can all agree if we bring in anything else than CSV it better be the _right_ solution and apply it to multiple places, not just for GTFS-Flex.\r\n\r\nI already have asked @isabelle-dr if we could have some sort of meeting on this topic.\r\n",

    "body": "### Context\r\nThe `networks.txt` and `route_networks.txt` are derived from [Ito World's  proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/182X7Ex31wjIqnWbG8DU_lNvvuQjeWjV1ch7RzbuIBqg/edit#heading=h.5ss3kq2uxev8). These two files provide another way to define a network to which route or multiple routes belong, and enable the naming of the network. Currently, the network is defined in a schedule file - `routes.network_id`. The following is the proposal for these two files from Ito World:\r\n\r\n### networks.txt\r\nFile: **Optional**\r\nPrimary key (`network_id`)\r\n\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\"><b style=\"font-weight:normal;\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-8a670008-7fff-2fab-c34f-15d3cff9324c\"><div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:0pt;\" align=\"left\">\r\n\r\nField Name | Type | Presence | Description\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nnetwork_id | Unique ID | Required | Identifies a network. Must be unique in networks.txt.\r\nnetwork_name | Text | Optional | The name of the network as displayed to the rider.\r\n\r\n</div></b>\r\n\r\n### route_networks.txt\r\nFile: **Optional**\r\nPrimary key (`*`)\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\"><b style=\"font-weight:normal;\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-f25e4a7f-7fff-a077-b5de-b2a2fe38f584\"><div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:0pt;\" align=\"left\">\r\n\r\nField Name | Type | Presence | Description\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nnetwork_id | Foreign ID referencing networks.network_id | Required | Identifies a network to which one or multiple route_ids belong. \r\nroute_id | Foreign ID referencing routes.route_id | Required | Identifies a route.\r\n\r\n</div></b>\r\n\r\n### Values\r\n- Make it possible for producers to create fares datasets without adding information to schedule file, especially useful when fares dataset and schedule dataset are handled by different parties.\r\n- Producers can name networks.\r\n- It will synchronize the definition of the `areas.txt` and `stop_areas.txt` mechanism\r\n\r\n### Topics/risks can be discussed\r\n- Currently a route can belong to only 1 network, do we want to release the many-to-many relationship?\r\n- If we add these two files, how do we deal with `routes.network_id`? Do we want to specify this in spec?\r\n  - Is there many `routes.as-route` implementation in the wild? Does it affect adopting these two files?\r\n\r\nPlease share any thoughts on `route_networks.txt` and `networks.txt` in this issue.",

    "body": "GTFS-Flex is a GTFS extension that aims to facilitate discoverability of Demand Responsive Transportation Services. This extension describes services that operate according to a schedule, but also include one or more flexible features, such as:\r\n- **Dial-a-ride service**: the vehicle serves a zone where pickups and drop offs are allowed during certain service hours.\r\n- **Route deviation services**: the vehicle serves a fixed route and ordered set of stops, and may detour to pick up or drop off a passenger between stops.\r\n- **Point-to-zone service**: the rider can board at a fixed stop such as a train station, and then alight anywhere within an area, or vice versa. Departures from some locations are scheduled or timed with other services.\r\n- **Point deviation or checkpoint service**: the rider can board at a fixed stop, and then alight anywhere among an unordered list of stops, or the opposite. The driver only serves stops at which a request is made.\r\n\r\nFor more information please see [original proposal](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-flex/blob/master/spec/reference.md) and [issue#382](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/382)(closed since we changed the scope).\r\n\r\nIn the working meeting on June 28th, there was an agreement among the group community to pursue an iteration that covers all fields currently produced and consumed. Therefore, all fields that appear as \u201c**in discussion**\u201d in the [adoption tracker](https://gtfs.org/extensions/flex/#current) are included in this PR.\r\n\r\n### The changes in this PR are:\r\n\r\n- Modify file:\r\n  - Modify `stop_areas.txt` to allow grouping of GeoJSON locations and/or stops which allow predetermined groups of these features to be specified on individual rows of `stop_times.txt`.\r\n  - Modify `stop_times.txt` to clarify elements of the current specification necessary to inform data consumers of how to interpret the added and extended files and fields \r\n- Extend file:\r\n  - Extend `stop_times.txt` with `start_pickup_drop_off_window` and `end_pickup_drop_off_window` to define the time that demand responsive transportation service becomes available/ends in a GeoJSON location, stop area or stop.\r\n  - Extend `stop_times.txt` with `pickup_booking_rule_id` and `drop_off_booking_rule_id` to define links to booking rules\r\n- Add new file:\r\n  - `locations.geojson`, to define zones (`Polygon` or `Multipolygon`) where riders can request either pickup or drop off.\r\n  - `booking_rules.txt`, to define the booking rules that provide riders information about how to request service.\r\n\r\nHere is a [data example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w5EHuHfxvejqApJFHA1Z0K2KytD9zahwbf8zyRlP_Ls/edit#gid=1451132209) for [RufBus](https://uvg-online.com/rufbus-angermuende/) in Angerm\u00fcnde and Gartzer, Germany. The image below is an example illustrating how the data could be presented in a trip planner:\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/google/transit/assets/126435471/c986f79a-0164-4e38-a552-7e37405fe133\" width=\"180\" height=\"400\">\r\n\r\nBased on the previous discussions, there are still some outstanding items that need to be clarified in this PR, before we proceed to the voting process:\r\n- [PR#50](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-flex/pull/50) - Should we change `prior_notice_last_time`/`prior_notice_start_time` from `Conditionally Required` to `Optional`? For cases in which a service has defined earliest/last days but unknown or undefined earliest/last times, should we ask producers to explicitly define earliest/last times or it\u2019s okay to not provide values?\r\nIf we change to Optional, what is the empty semantics? (e.g. 24:00:00)\r\n- [issue#72](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-flex/issues/72) - Do we want to allow GeoJSON locations and stop areas having fixed `arrival_time` and `departure_time`? (i.e. Change presence of `pickup_drop_off_window` from `Conditionally Required` to `Conditionally Forbidden`) @klement-MENTZ mentioned there are \u201carea-based\u201d services that have fixed departure time. \r\n- [Issue#339](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/339) - Do we want to move `locations.geojson.properties` to `stops.txt`? It seems there was a soft consensus of NOT moving it, we would like to confirm this.\r\n- [Issue#70](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-flex/issues/70) - What does `continuous_pick_up`/`continuous_drop_off` mean for stop areas and GeoJSON locations? Do we want to forbid continuous pickup/drop-off for `stop_times` that refer to a locations.geojson or stop area?\r\n\r\nPlease go through the changes and outstanding items and share your thoughts here. MobilityData plans to hold a technical meeting to discuss any remaining outstanding items and build on the consensus reached within the discussion in this PR. Details will be announced soon.\r\n",

Based on feedback in https://github.com/google/transit/issues/375 and some other discussions, it looks like the one key starting point is providing clear guidelines in the specification for when a field or file is recommended for use.\r\n\r\n[Before creating this PR, we did an initial review](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/109w3RFyERjtLYR-dSMsltl386xWJdMn8me1iUnwcdRk/edit#gid=0) of all places in the spec and best practices where they offer advice on when to add a file or field. This spreadsheet also includes the corresponding [Canonical Validator](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator) rule for each best practice for cross-referencing.\r\n\r\n### **Proposed solution**\r\n\r\nAdding a Recommended presence in the spec that conforms to RFC conventions. This would make it possible to clearly state that a field or file is not required, but adding it is a best practice that should be considered. Making it immediately obvious that a file or field is recommended in the spec reduces confusion, while preserving backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nThis change would not affect validity or the quality evaluation of the dataset according to the Canonical Validator, since the best practices are already translated to warnings in the validator. Any missing recommended field or file would generate a warning in the validator.\r\n\r\nIf the associated PR is adopted, MobilityData will open a PR on https://github.com/MobilityData/GTFS_Schedule_Best-Practices so that all best practices that have been reconciled + adopted into the spec are removed from the best practices repo.\r\n\r\n**When is a file/field Recommended instead of Optional?**\r\n\r\nThe Recommended presence is used for any file/field that should be used universally, e.g `feed_info.txt` or `agency_id`. This is information producers should provide in all circumstances, but is not required in order to preserve backwards compatibility. \r\n\r\nAny file/field that is recommended only under specific circumstances (such as `route_short_name` when there is a brief service designation) keeps the Optional presence and the words \"SHOULD\" and/or \"recommended\" are used in its description. \r\n\r\n### **Alternatives considered**\r\n\r\n**Adding no additional presences and keeping all SHOULDs in the description**\r\nThe concern with this approach was that it remains confusing for producers for a file/field to be optional but recommended in all cases. [Conversation here.](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/375#issuecomment-1520564752)\r\n\r\n**Adding a Conditionally Recommended presence**\r\nThis was originally drafted, this seemed to overly complicate the spec and create confusion about the difference between Recommended presences and the Optional presence. [Conversation here.](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/376#issuecomment-1546340051)\r\n",

    "body": "### Context\r\nEDIT 2023-11-28: You can find the spec modeling proposal here [https://share.mobilitydata.org/rule-priority](https://share.mobilitydata.org/rule-priority).\r\n\r\nThe `rule_priority` field is derived from [Ito World's \"override\" proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q7mo2k4j1-uEmaLYIQVoNqdR2a_xMj9Kc-iA9mGwnXo/edit#heading=h.4bej6s69xndk). In the past discussions there seems to be a consensus on renaming it to rule_priority while keeping the same semantics ([PR#357](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/357#issuecomment-1521374672)). The `rule_priority` field \"is used to simply represent cases when some matching rules need to take precedence over other matching rules.\" It is an experimental field in the current [fares v2 proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19j-f-wZ5C_kYXmkLBye1g42U-kvfSVgYLkkG5oyBauY/edit#bookmark=id.4k2yvx7ji4v9).\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\nAssuming the fare from ZoneA to ZoneB is 3.00, while there is an exception that from Airport Station within ZoneA to Central Station within ZoneB is 2.00. A straightforward approach would be defining **two** separate rules for ZoneA to ZoneB and Airport Station to Central Station. However, for a leg from Airport Station to Central Station, both rules would match, as Airport Station and Central Station belong to ZoneA and ZoneB respectively. (please see [Ito World's proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q7mo2k4j1-uEmaLYIQVoNqdR2a_xMj9Kc-iA9mGwnXo/edit#) for more details)\r\n\r\nSimilar cases for time-variable fares: Assuming the peak hour is from 7:00 to 10:00 with a fare of 3.00, and the remaining hours are considered off-peak with a fare of 2.00. A simple approach could be like:\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\"><b style=\"font-weight:normal;\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-e2b90748-7fff-24cd-3f0a-e07cb080896f\"><div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:-41.25pt;\" align=\"left\">\r\n\r\ntimeframe_group_id | start_time | end_time | service_id\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\npeak | 7:00:00 | 10:00:00 | everyday\r\n\r\n</div></b>\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\"><b style=\"font-weight:normal;\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-9be7a645-7fff-6364-d20c-9b04688fe450\"><div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:-21pt;\" align=\"left\">\r\n\r\nleg_group_id | fare_product | from_timeframe_group_id | to_timeframe_group_id\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\n1 | peak | peak | \u00a0\r\n1 | offpeak | \u00a0 | \u00a0\r\n\r\n</div></b>\r\nHowever, for a leg starting at 7:30, both rules would match.\r\n\r\n`rule_priority` indicates the priority among multiple matching rules, thereby providing accurate fares to riders. \r\nAdding `rule_priority` to the time-variable fares example above:\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\"><b style=\"font-weight:normal;\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-c7daf807-7fff-d2ea-8143-f56d63b66bec\"><div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:-21pt;\" align=\"left\">\r\n\r\nleg_group_id | fare_product | from_timeframe_group_id | to_timeframe_group_id | rule_priority\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n1 | peak | peak | \u00a0 | 1\r\n1 | offpeak | \u00a0 | \u00a0 | \u00a0\r\n\r\n</div></b>\r\nNow only peak fare would be selected for a leg starting at 7:30, since the peak one with highest priority \"1\".\r\n\r\n### Alternative considered\r\nFor the time-variable fares cases, in addition to defining the peak hour timeframe, producers have to explicitly define all other times of the day as off-peak timeframes (0:00-7:00 & 10:00-24:00 for the example above), and define rules for both peak and off-peak timeframes. The similar approach for zone-based fares requires producers to provide additional entries in `fare_leg_rules.txt`, which in some cases can be a significant number of extra rules (see Ito's proposal for more details). This approach could be less intuitive and blurs the original intention of simplifying producers' data.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease share any thoughts on `rule_priority` in this issue. ",

    "body": "### \ud83d\udc4b Introduction\r\nHello everyone, I am Elias, the new community manager for transit specifications at MobilityData. I am excited to share that MobilityData intends to facilitate the adoption of the GTFS-Flex extension into the official spec. It is great to see that some of you have already started using GTFS-Flex.\r\n\r\n- [Flex Pilot project a collaboration between MNDoT, Trillium, Transit, Cambridge Systematics, and Token Transit. ](https://blog.transitapp.com/case-study/mndot-gtfs-flex-bringing-rural-riders-into-the-fold/)\r\n- Consumers, [IBI](https://www.ibigroup.com/) , [OTP](https://www.opentripplanner.org/), and [Transit](https://transitapp.com/), have implemented some forms of GTFS-Flex on their platforms. \r\n- Visit the [original GTFS-Flex repo](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-flex) to access older versions of the extension. \r\n\r\n\r\n### \ud83e\udd14 Problem\r\nAs many of you know, services like dial-a-ride are often brushed over by riders, who sometimes have no clue they even exist. This lack of accessibility is an issue for producers, consumers, and riders. Imagine a group of tourists arriving at your local airport and would like to reach a rural area that does not offer scheduled bus routes but only an on-demand bus service. The tourists check their preferred trip planner app and do not find a viable public transportation option; they end up renting a car. Being tourists, they missed all of your paper flyers posted along the hallway announcing the on-demand service. Not only is your service underutilized, but it lacks the discoverability to meet current and future rider demand. This is where GTFS-Flex comes in by providing that information to the rider allowing them to enjoy the services you worked hard to promote.\r\n\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udd2d Scope\r\nBased on what has already been tested in the field, we see GTFS-Flex solving the following key use cases:\r\n\r\n![WIP Internal  GTFS-Flex Roadmap - User Journey (2)](https://github.com/google/transit/assets/130911698/f71de4a1-aec1-4845-94ed-fd12000f9e31)\r\n\r\n**Display available demand responsive transportation services for rider discovery**\r\n\r\n![image5](https://github.com/google/transit/assets/130911698/81367c8f-2001-4dcd-82e4-4246e1a0a30a)\r\n_Source: IBI_\r\n\r\n\r\n**Deviated bus routes**\r\n\r\n![WIP Internal  GTFS-Flex Roadmap - Frame 1](https://github.com/google/transit/assets/130911698/1c93fb0d-a2f7-47bf-b829-7bedcc5e95de)\r\n_Source: Transit App_\r\n\r\n**Dial-a-ride**\r\n\r\n![WIP Internal  GTFS-Flex Roadmap - Frame 2](https://github.com/google/transit/assets/130911698/8f82fc86-f584-4cda-a1dc-32ba553a3816)\r\n_Source: Transit App_\r\n\r\n**Displaying contact information (phone number and/or website URL) for booking**\r\n\r\n![image7](https://github.com/google/transit/assets/130911698/27a8b097-e823-406b-9499-8dcef221121a)\r\n_Source: Find a Ride_\r\n\r\n\r\n### \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb File and field names\r\nTo cover the base implementation of GTFS-Flex, MobilityData kindly asks you to review this [adoption tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OFeXBkeQue3Zumkkon85he9A-qc3eIPu8Eanfswt1V0/edit?usp=sharing). All of the fields in Green are what we considered essential for a base implementation. Those same fields are described below.

    "body": "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nI have a question regarding the `TripDescriptor.start_date`. Currently, the documentation tells me this:\r\n\r\nhttps://gtfs.org/realtime/reference/#message-tripdescriptor\r\n\r\nTwo questions:\r\n\r\n- Since the `start_date` timezone is not directly specified, I assume that it's in the corresponding agency timezone of the trip? Some fields in the specification are explicitly specified to be in UTC. For the rest I can assume that they refer to the GTFS-static local times? (to be translated like the GTFS-static data as described [here](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/574edc94981a21ef0ce90713f1cff7f6)).\r\n- What happens in case the first departure time is greater than `24:00:00`? The start date is the one specified in the `service_id` or the \"real\" start date (which would be for example on the next day)?\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\n***`calendar_dates.txt`***\r\n```\r\nservice_id,date,exception_type\r\nS,20190331,1\r\n```\r\n\r\n**`trips.txt`**\r\n```csv\r\nroute_id,service_id,trip_id,trip_headsign,block_id\r\nR_RE1,S,T_RE1,RE 1,1\r\nR_RE2,S,T_RE2,RE 2,1\r\n```\r\n\r\n**`stop_times.txt`**\r\n```csv\r\ntrip_id,arrival_time,departure_time,stop_id,stop_sequence,pickup_type,drop_off_type\r\nT_RE1,00:00:00,00:00:00,A,1,0,0\r\nT_RE1,48:30:00,48:30:00,B,2,0,0\r\nT_RE2,48:30:00,72:30:00,B,1,0,0\r\nT_RE2,72:30:00,96:30:00,C,2,0,0\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the first departure time of trip `T_RE2` would be on\r\n\r\n| from `service_id` | UTC First Departure  translated with offset at noon `-02:00` | Local First Departure |\r\n|------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\r\n| 2019-03-31         | 2019-04-01                | 2019-04-02               |\r\n\r\nI would guess that GTFS-RT is supposed to give me the date from `service_id` (2019-03-31) to refer to the trip. However, both other options would also be reasonable in a way.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI have not been able to get this information from the specification. Can someone please clarify how to handle these cases?",

    "body": "I had assumed this was reasonably implied but realized it wasn't explicit when I was recently debugging a GTFS feed. In the feed in question, the stop times `shape_dist_traveled` went from 0 to roughly 5.5 while the shape's distance went from 0 to 3.7.\r\n\r\nThis was a standard one-way pattern -- not a loop -- and there was no reasonable explanation for this (except possibly that they used different units, which is not acceptable), yet the [canonical validator](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator) did not throw an error. I subsequently used the older [Google validator](https://github.com/google/transitfeed/wiki/FeedValidator) and did get a warning -- both for the distance exceeding the shape's maximum and for a resulting side-effect of the stop being too far from the shape based on that distance.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that there's no reason the stop time's distance can ever legitimately exceed the shape's distance, but a few things I've heard or discussed with others as possibilities include:\r\n\r\n- Routes that Loop\r\n  - For a route that loops over itself (but does not have the same start and end point), I expect that the shape has to be drawn such that it actually loops over itself and there are two paths of the shape on top of each other. The `shape_dist_traveled` then helps indicate which portion of the path (the first time the bus goes down that street or the second) the stop time is connected to.\r\n  - For routes that create a circle and meet itself at the end, I believe the trip has to be split at this meeting point. The `shape_dist_traveled` cannot go from the maximum back to zero, and there is no indication in the spec or best practices that by exceeding the maximum of the shape the intent is that the bus continues along the shape again from the start. (This would be similar to the way we can pass midnight by using times in excess of 24 hours... but I don't believe this is acceptable or intended from the spec for shape distances.)\r\n- Improperly drawn/simplifed shapes\r\n  - Some producers simplify shapes incorrectly by not following the street grid and simply connecting stop locations with straight lines. In this case, perhaps a `shape_dist_traveled` in stop times could be greater than that of the shape, if it uses a more realistic street-traveled distance, but I don't think this makes for a valid GTFS file. This field is used to tell consumers where the stop (which is not _on_ the line) connects to the line, and if the stop times use an accurate street-traveled distance while the shape does not, the data in this field will be a big unmatched mess and the values won't match up in the way they are supposed to.\r\n\r\nI can't think of any other reason a stop time's distance can or should exceed the distance for the shape. Does anyone else have an example where this is expected or acceptable? I believe the intent of the spec is that it should not, and this PR clarifies that explicitly.",

If there are not separate times for arrival and departure at a stop, arrival_time and departure_time should be the same. For times occurring after midnight on the service day, enter the time as a value greater than 24:00:00 in HH:MM:SS **local time** for the day on which the trip schedule begins.\r\n\r\nProblem (quoted from Elizabeth in #322):\r\nThe above definition, with use of the word \"local\" implies that `stop_times.txt` should use the time zone of the local stop. However, the `stop.stop_timezone` definition clearly states that if used, that `stop_times` should refer to `agency.agency_timezone`.\r\n\r\nThis problem caused Amtrak to provide incorrect data in 2022.\r\n\r\nProposed solution:\r\nClarify definition of `time`, `stop_times.arrival_time`, and `stop_times.departure_time`\r\n\r\nFixes issue#322 (see [issue#322](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/322) for previous discussion)",

    "body": "### **Problem**\r\n\r\nAs originally mentioned in https://github.com/google/transit/issues/375, MobilityData\u2019s heard a need to merge best practices into the spec to increase their visibility to producers and reduce confusion between the two documents. We\u2019ve been exploring what a good starting \u201crelease\u201d or iteration would look like to begin this work. Based on feedback in #375 and some other discussions, it looks like the one key initial challenge to solve is reconciling places in the best practices and spec where their advice conflicts. \r\n\r\nSome examples:\r\n\r\n- feed_info.txt is Optional in the spec, but recommended in all cases in best practices. \r\n- agency_id is Optional if there is only one transit agency in the spec, but always recommended in the best practices\r\n\r\n### **Solution**\r\n\r\nAdding a Recommended and Conditionally Recommended presence in the spec that conforms to RFC conventions. This would make it possible to clearly state that a field or file is not required, but adding it is a best practice that should be considered. Making it immediately obvious that a file or field is recommended in the spec reduces confusion, while preserving backwards compatibility. \r\n\r\nThis change would not affect validity or the quality evaluation of the dataset according to the Canonical Validator, since the best practices are already warnings in the validator. Any recommended field or file would generate a warning in the validator. \r\n\r\n### **Recommended Scope**\r\n\r\n[MobilityData has done an initial review](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/109w3RFyERjtLYR-dSMsltl386xWJdMn8me1iUnwcdRk/edit#gid=0) of all places in the spec and best practices where they offer contradictory advice on when to add a file or field.\r\n\r\nAll conflicting best practices that don\u2019t require adopting a new field into the spec relate to\r\n\r\n- `feed_info.txt` file and fields\r\n- `route_short_name` in `routes.txt`\r\n- `agency_id` in `routes.txt`, `agency.txt`, and `fare_attributes.txt`\r\n- `timepoint` in `stop_times.txt`\r\n- `block_id` in `trips.txt`\r\n- Looping or inlining routes\r\n    - `shape_dist_traveled` in `stop_times.txt`\r\n    - `shape_dist_traveled` in `shapes.txt`\r\n    - `direction_id` in `trips.txt`\r\n    \r\nAfter the associated PR is adopted, MobilityData will open a PR on https://github.com/MobilityData/GTFS_Schedule_Best-Practices so that all best practices that have been reconciled + adopted into the spec are removed from the best practices repo.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful to get feedback on: \r\n\r\n- The scope itself: is there any best practice here that there isn\u2019t consensus on and ought to be clarified further before it\u2019s added to the spec?\r\n- If there are particular best practices in this list that are high value to trip planners and regulators to reconcile\r\n- Any recommendations for revising language related to the best practices on looping or inlining routes \r\n\r\n### Alternatives Considered\r\n\r\n- First iteration focused on adding dataset publishing guidelines (https://github.com/google/transit/issues/375). There seems to be a need to clean up discrepancies first before there would be viable buy-in to adding new shoulds and sections to the spec. This is a viable phase 2. \r\n- Status quo: does not resolve need for a better spec experience for producers ",

    "body": "### **Problem** \r\n\r\nMobilityData\u2019s heard a number of pains from the community about the GTFS best practices and the spec\u2019s SHOULD statements living in two different places:\r\n\r\n- Producers do not always refer to the best practices, and so moving these into the official spec would give the best practices greater visibility and improve data quality for everyone \r\n\r\n- Merging the best practices in the spec would make it easier for regulators to point producers to one place to get the information they need to create their GTFS feeds\r\n\r\n### **Solution**\r\n\r\nBased on this feedback, MobilityData is interested in working to merge the best practices into the official spec. [We started this work by removing best practices already covered by the spec in 2021.](https://github.com/MobilityData/GTFS_Schedule_Best-Practices/pull/44) We recognize this is a big effort that will require much community discussion, so we want to start with a small section as a pilot to see if we can gain momentum on this and make some incremental changes that will be high value. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve seen some initial public interest in merging the [Dataset Publishing and General Practices section](https://github.com/MobilityData/GTFS_Schedule_Best-Practices/blob/master/en/best-practices.md#dataset-publishing--general-practices) of the Best Practices into the spec ([Slack conversation here](https://mobilitydata-io.slack.com/archives/C3NH9A9TQ/p1674487393867409?thread_ts=1673977488.805899&cid=C3NH9A9TQ) - you can [join the MobilityData slack](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZbZB9ql_Xl-1uBtmvYmA0fwfm1UX92SyWAdkuMEDfxac5w/viewform?_ga=2.262869135.2013075714.1680701629-892322330.1649683510&_gl=1%2A6d1cbr%2A_ga%2AODkyMzIyMzMwLjE2NDk2ODM1MTA.%2A_ga_55GPMF0W9Z%2AMTY4MDcxODY3OS4xMzcuMC4xNjgwNzE4Njg4LjAuMC4w) to see the discussion). Based on this, we\u2019re seeking more feedback to assess interest and get insight. \r\n\r\n### **Recommended Scope**\r\n\r\nMobilityData suggests keeping the scope to the minimum updates required for the Dataset Publishing and General Practices section to be merged into the official spec. This would include \r\n\r\n- Updating the link to the [Google transitfeed tool merge function](https://github.com/google/transitfeed/wiki/Merge) so it references a list of merge tools instead\r\n- Making all SHOULD language explicit\r\n\r\nThere would be no changes to the severity of any statements - they would all remain SHOULD statements. \r\n\r\nWe do recognize there are outstanding issues and PRs related to this section, which we recommend resolving in future iterations. If a PR was voted on and passed, MobilityData would create issues in google/transit that link to the original best practices discussions so the work can continue. \r\n\r\n**List of outstanding discussions related to the Dataset Publishing and General Practices section (feel free to add others):** \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/MobilityData/GTFS_Schedule_Best-Practices/pull/49\r\nhttps://github.com/MobilityData/GTFS_Schedule_Best-Practices/issues/48\r\nhttps://github.com/MobilityData/GTFS_Schedule_Best-Practices/pull/40",

    "body": "It would be convenient to have possibility to bundle-fill the area.\r\n\r\nMotivation: in Athens there are `airport` area and `urban` area. The `airport` area can be simply modeled by adding stops to the `stop_areas.txt`. The `urban` area contains all other stops of the city and there's a lot of such. Therefore if a provider adds some stops to the stops.txt in the `urban` zone he could miss to add them to the `stop_areas.txt` and it will fall to an issue.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m proposing to add new file `area_networks.txt` as many-to-many relation between `network_id` and `area_id`. This means that all stops of the routes marked by `network_id` will belong to the `area_id`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally I\u2019m proposing to extend `stop_areas.txt` by `type` (with possible values `include` or `exclude`) which will defaults to `include`.\r\n",

    "body": "I was searching in documentations and proposals and did not find any regular way how to express this.\r\n\r\nIn our system in Czechia we have a lot of cases of trip-to-trip transfers, where the second vehicle waits for the first one, but only for a specified maximum amount of time. For instance a bus waits for a train, but at most 20 minutes. If the train is delayed more than 20 minutes, the bus leaves and the passengers need to wait for the next bus. This value is specified per-transfer, so the best option for us would be to extend _transfers.txt_ by adding a new column `max_waiting_time` which would specify this value in seconds or it could be left empty if the vehicle waits _forever_ or the waiting time could not be specified (this way backward compatibility would be ensured).\r\n\r\nThe usage is desired in following way\r\n\r\n* Applications can inform passengers that the vehicle waits at most X minutes\r\n* More sofisticated planners that incorporate realtime delays could calculate with this value to determine that the transfer could be missed, even though the vehicle is expected to wait\r\n\r\nAre there any other producers/consumers using trip-to-trip transfers that would find this useful?",

It could take months before we adopt Rider Categories in GTFS, based on the [priorities list we've defined with the community](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/341#issuecomment-1339947915).\r\n\r\n## Proposition\r\nAdopt `fare_products.rider_category_id` right now, and adopt `rider_categories.txt` in a further iteration. \r\n`rider_category_id` is currently produced at least by:\r\n- Interline ([source](https://www.interline.io/blog/mtc-regional-gtfs-feed-fares-updates/)) \r\n- San Diego Metropolitan Transit System ([dataset](https://www.sdmts.com/google_transit_files/google_transit.zip))\r\n- Maryland DOT ([source](https://mdotmta-gtfs.s3.amazonaws.com/mdotmta_gtfs_metro.zip))\r\n- Cal-ITP (50+ agencies)\r\n\r\n... and consumed by Open Trip Planner (cc @leonardehrenfried to confirm).\r\n\r\n## Advantages\r\nIt might sound like it doesn't add much value to add this field alone without further information about what the rider category is, but there are still some pros:\r\n1. Make the `fare_products.txt` design more clear (see #367 for more context).\r\n2. Increase the \"usefulness\" of the adopted portion of Fares v2, make producers aware that it exists and this is the way to represent it.\r\n3. Mitigate the risk of ending up with this type of data that would need to be updated when we adopt Rider Categories. This is not technically invalid data, but it's not how the `fare_products.txt` was designed and forces to have duplication that could be avoided in `fare_leg_rules.txt`.\r\n\r\n| fare_product_id | amount | currency |\r\n|-----------------|--------|----------|\r\n|   adult_fare | 3.3      | CAD      |\r\n|   children_fare | 0    | CAD      |\r\n\r\n## Alternatives considered\r\nAdopt Rider Categories all at once.\r\n\r\nI'd like to have general thoughts there; if we collectively think this is useful, I can open a PR for this.",

We saw the need for a more focused specification tailored to consistent and accurate representation of detours.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, we came up with [GTFS-TripModifications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e4NYfTsY_rMt04z2QjGfyFXOxmUrCXMgALXfulj_Ui8/edit#). Indeed, GTFS-TripModifications allow us to give more specific details and to be more efficient when a detour affects multiple trips, compared to a complete replacement of each affected trip, as is currently provided for in GTFS-ServiceChanges v3.1.\r\n\r\nWe just released today our first implementation of [our detour feature](https://site.transitapp.com/transit-can-now-detect-where-your-bus-has-been-detoured/) that uses data formatted in this proposition. Swiftly is also already interested in producing this data. \r\n\r\nWe welcome your feedback either here, or directly in the Google doc! Note that GTFS-TripModifications builds on GTFS-ServiceChanges v3.1 and uses some parts of it. This proposal doesn\u2019t prevent the remaining features in that specification from being adopted in the future. \r\n",

Two sources of confusion were brought-up to our attention:\r\n\r\n**First**, the definition of `fare_products.txt` is:\r\n> To describe the different types of tickets or fares that can be purchased by riders.\r\n\r\nWhen in reality, some fare products represent virtual products that can't be purchased (by themselves) by riders, such as a transfer cost.\r\n\r\n**Second**: although `fare_poduct_id`'s type is `ID` and not `Unique ID`, it's unclear in the spec that several Fare Products can be grouped under the same `fare_product_id`, and under which conditions this should be done to ensure an efficient fare design.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nThe file definition should be modified to include virtual products that can't be directly bought by riders.\r\nThe file definition should give insights on when fare products should be grouped under the same ID.\r\nThe definition of `fare_poduct_id` should be modified to include something like: \r\n\r\n> Multiple records in `fare_products.txt` may have the same `fare_product_id`, in which case all fare products with that ID will be applied when referenced from another file.\r\n",

In the original PR discussion #303, there were two feed providers who utilized `transfer_type=4` but there was never a producer who utilized `transfer_type=5`.  Per the spec guiding principles, [speculative features are discouraged](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/CHANGES.md#speculative-features-are-discouraged).  I acknowledge the potential use-case for `transfer_type=5` but I'm not sure it's been fully proven out.  I'd be willing to keep `5` as a reserved value if we think there is someone actively working on this.\r\n\r\n2) (Small) Revert the change that made `from_stop_id` and `to_stop_id` conditionally required.  After discussions with the original change authors ([link](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/303#issuecomment-1270759304)), it became clear that the intention was that stop id fields are still required, but that they just shouldn't refer to a station for the in-seat transfer types.\r\n\r\nSee the [related discussion](https://mobilitydata-io.slack.com/archives/C3FFFKX9C/p1665087714843639) from the #gtfs Slack channel and also in https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/pull/1266.\r\n\r\nAnnouncement in https://groups.google.com/g/gtfs-changes/c/kF-HUR-L-kU/m/NJ8Vm6yJAQAJ",

I would have assumed that this vital piece of information would be recorded in the header section at least to allow apps an automated means to check that it is using the correct file versions.\r\n\r\nIs this correct?\r\n\r\nIf so, maybe this needs changing, or have others implemented other automated steps to let your app know that the static files it is using need updating. How does one know how to handle the transition or swap over day. Does one just have to assume that the version you've just downloaded is the same one the GTFS-R is using etc.",

    "body": "When the initial Fares v2 base implementation was added to the official spec (#286), it also included some changes for Fares v1.  Specifically, `fare_rules.txt` was now marked as conditionally required if `fare_attributes.txt` is present. I believe this change was a mistake and should be reverted.\r\n\r\nIt's my understanding that `fare_attributes.txt` has always been allowed with a single entry to indicate a flat fare for all rides.  In this scenario, `fare_rules.txt` is not required.  This behavior was documented on the original [Fare Examples wiki entry](https://web.archive.org/web/20111207224351/https://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/wiki/FareExamples) and has been (described elsewhere)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mK3--o5g4-3cCXaqmch92U63JTwChh0L2VCmcDViIlM/edit#heading=h.1xji1nf0ko4z] as well.  More importantly, I count ~40 feeds in the MobilityDatabase that are currently relying on this behavior.\r\n\r\nThere was also a comment from @flocsy calling out this behavior in the original PR discussion (https://github.com/google/transit/pull/286#issuecomment-1082480847), but I think it got dropped in the lengthy Fares v2 discussion?\r\n\r\nGiven all that evidence, my proposal is to revert the language change making `fare_rules.txt` conditionally required.\r\n\r\nSee also the [related discussion](https://mobilitydata-io.slack.com/archives/C01KL7PR170/p1664918057609029) in the #gtfs-fares slack channel and [related discussion](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/pull/1261#issuecomment-1267465819) for the gtfs-validator.\r\n\r\ngtfs-changes announcement: https://groups.google.com/g/gtfs-changes/c/Jn8OIuK6J54/m/RWg9hqwTBQAJ",

This should not be deduced from the sequence of previous positions, which clients can compute from previous data.\r\n\r\nThe general statement in the [VehiclePositions](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/vehicle-positions.md) documentation has even less detail:\r\n\r\n> Bearing - direction that the vehicle is facing\r\n\r\nThe [TIDES data spec ](https://tides-transit.github.io/TIDES/main/tables/#vehicle-locations) would like to be consistent with GTFS, but without this variable being sufficiently defined we will not be able to do so.\r\n\r\n# Options\r\n\r\n1. Keep ambiguous definition of `Bearing`, add new enum field to define what it is in reference to i.e. `BearingReference`\r\n2. Keep field name of `Bearing`, but tighten up the definition to be a reference to True North (**potential breaking change if the alternate def is used**) \r\n3. Add new field `Heading` which is tightly defined as degrees clockwise from True North\r\n\r\n# Discussion Points / Questions\r\n\r\n1. What is the probable universe of data producers which produce bearings that are not relative to True North? Is it a handful, a zillion?\r\n2. If there are a few of the above...then are data-consumers just inferring the reference direction from the data?\r\n\r\n",

This change results in some existing production data becoming invalid, and I'd like to know if this was the intention.\r\n\r\nQuoting @bdferris-v2 below, who is currently updating the [Canonical GTFS Schedule Validator](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator) with the Fares v2 base implementation rules.\r\n\"Looking back at the original Fares V1 example documentation (not really hosted anywhere anymore, but available at https://web.archive.org/web/20111207224351/https://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/wiki/FareExamples), having a `fare_attributes.txt` file with a single entry and no `fare_rules.txt` file was a supported use-case for systems that have a single base fare.\r\nThere are 62 feeds in the [MobilityDatabase](https://database.mobilitydata.org/) that have a `fare_attributes.txt` file but no `fare_rules.txt` file. Of those, 39 have a single entry in `fare_attributes.txt`, indicating a default fare.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a [comment](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/286#issuecomment-1082480847) from @flocsy calling out this behavior, and I think during the roundtable discussions, it was decided not to tackle this problem to keep the focus on the scope of the PR (please correct me if I'm wrong).\r\n\r\n## Needs\r\nI would like to have insights from those who were involved in the Fares v2 base implementation so that MobilityData can best support the organizations that might be affected by this change.\r\n- Is the behavior described above now a spec violation?\r\n- I know there were many iterations in this PR. Was this change intentional, or was it part of an earlier version?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance \ud83d\ude4f",

I need some clarification regarding the route_sort_order field in routes.txt.\r\n\r\nThe current description of this field says \"Orders the routes in a way which is ideal for presentation to customers. Routes with smaller route_sort_order values should be displayed first.\"\r\n\r\nWhat does \"displayed first\" mean?  Let's say we have two routes with overlapping sections and route_sort_order 1 and 2.  I could interpret \"displayed first\" in two conflicting ways:\r\n1) The route with route_sort_order 1 is drawn first in the map.  The route with route_sort_order 2 is drawn ON TOP of route_sort_order 1, thus covering it up.\r\n2) The route with route_sort_order 1 is drawn on top in the map, covering up the route with route_sort_order 2.\r\n\r\nHoping someone can clarify the correct interpretation.\r\n\r\nIt would also be good to update the documentation to make this clearer.  For various bureaucratic reasons at my company, I'm unable to submit PRs myself in this repo, so it would be lovely if someone else could take care of it.",

    "body": "# \u201cDELETED\u201d Enum Proposal\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nEquipment and staffing challenges faced by transit providers during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in, among many things, more frequent trip cancellations. The GTFS-RT spec defines an official way to convey to consuming applications that a trip has been canceled by a service provider, via the trip `schedule_relationship` of `CANCELED`. Many producers and consumers utilize this functionality today.\r\n\r\nThe current definition of `CANCELED` is \u201cA trip that existed in the schedule but was removed.\u201d This definition does not provide a way to distinguish between two very different types of removals:\r\n\r\nScenario 1: Trips where a transit provider would like to actively communicate a cancellation to riders\r\nScenario 2: Trips where a transit provider would like to entirely remove information about the corresponding trip from consuming applications, so the trip is not shown as canceled to riders, e.g. when one or more trips are entirely being replaced by other trips.\r\n\r\nBy current definition, consumers must make assumptions over what a producer means when they utilize `CANCELED`. Producers have no way to indicate the type of passenger communication desired. For scenario 2 above, this leads to cases where riders see that trips have been canceled (for example, by an app or trip planner showing a scheduled time crossed out), which is misleading when one or more trips have been replaced by different trips. It can be especially distracting if this is happening for many trips on a route.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nThis proposal adds a new trip `schedule_relationship` of `DELETED`, which can be used to convey that a transit provider intends for a trip to entirely disappear from public-facing applications. To minimize impact on current implementations and maximize simplicity, the `DELETED` enumeration would be defined with the same definition as `CANCELED` but with additional precision: \u201cA trip that existed in the schedule but was removed and is not intended to be seen by users.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis addition to the spec immediately removes ambiguity over how to implement `CANCELED` for consumers. For producers, it allows service providers to communicate removals of service in a way that reflects rider understanding of the service - i.e., frequency-based, show-up-and-go service removals might be understood differently from less frequent services, or services where users know and understand the service at the trip level.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, this proposal also greatly clarifies how to display trips that are impacted by changes proposed in GTFS-ServiceChanges v3.1.\r\n\r\n#### Authors notes\r\nSubmitted on behalf of a third-party: Maryland Department of Transportation\r\nThe following is a proposal drafted by a few folks at MDOT in Maryland that we (Swiftly) think it makes sense to introduce now.",

It also makes sense to have the field given that there is already bikes_allowed in trips.txt.\r\n\r\nThere has already discussion about a separate stop_amenities.txt file, however this variable makes sense to be included with the standard text files for consistency with other transit-related variables (i.e., bikes_allowed).\r\n\r\nThere are obviously complexities with bicycle parking that may not be expressed by a simple field (e.g. maybe parking is not always available or requires a pass to access), there are also a wide range of bicycle parking infrastructure that is available (e.g. simple bike rack outside, protected bike shed, elevated storage with security, etc.). However, the same is true for the wheelchair_boarding variable. In general, having imperfect information is more useful than having no information at all.\r\n\r\nAny feedback on this proposal would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nNote: [Transcollines](http://transcollines.ca/) has volunteered to be the producer when this goes into voting\r\n\r\nJ.

These applications process new stop_ids and new shape_ids, but will often ignore existing ones between datasets, even when values such as lat/lons, stop names, or codes, are changed.\r\n\r\nIt seems common sense to us to assume that a record should be able to maintain a consistent id when a new dataset is posted but still have other changes to the data (e.g., stop_name, lat/lon) incorporated. Consumers should be processing such changes regardless of whether a record has a fresh id.\r\n\r\nWe are wondering if there is either a gap in the Best Practices (http://gtfs.org/schedule/best-practices/#dataset-publishing-general-practices) or if this is an existing norm that is not being enforced/followed?",

    "body": "## Context\r\nWhen a field is described as _Conditionally Required_ in the spec, three cases exist:\r\n\r\n1. A field or file is **required under a certain condition, optional otherwise**. It is the case for the `calendar.txt`, `calendar_dates.txt`, and `levels.txt` files, for the fields `stops.stop_name`, `stops.stop_lat`, `stops.stop_lon`, `stops.zone_id` and for many other fields.\r\n\r\n2. A field or file is **required under a certain condition, forbidden otherwise**. it is the case for `fare_transfer_rules.duration_limit_type`, `translations.record_id`, and `translations.field_value`.\r\n\r\n3. A field or file is **required under a certain condition, forbidden under another condition, and optional otherwise**. It is the case for `stops.parent_station`.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nIn the [Fares v2 base implementation PR](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/286), a new presence condition was added to the spec: **Conditionally Forbidden**, and was applied to `fare_transfer_rules.transfer_count`. This field has the behavior described in category 2 above: required under a certain condition, forbidden otherwise. \r\nWe believe this field was initially designed as: _forbidden under a certain condition, optional otherwise_, and then changed when modifications were made to the PR.\r\nThis adds unnecessary complexity to the spec, this condition should only be used if a field is either forbidden or optional.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nRemove the _Conditionally Forbidden_ presence condition from the spec and describe `fare_transfer_rules.transfer_count` as _Conditionally Required_.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to open a PR to do this fix if there is agreement from the community.",

    "body": "Hey everyone - we have been working with one route behaviour and we have identified a few issues that we want to run by the community. \r\n\r\nThe definition of `routes.as_route` is not very concise, our intention with the sentence \u201c*transferring within the network is ignored for fare transfer calculations*\u201d was that riders can transfer within a network without any form of fare processing (no taps, no ticket validation, no fees, etc.). Riders can simply get off the vehicle from the first service and get on the other one, for example: transferring between subway lines generally does not involve any fare processing since riders do not exit the fare paid zone. However, for most services, this is not the case, generally, transferring between different bus or train services requires some form of fare validation (even if the transfer is free).\r\n\r\nEven if we go with the subway example, modeling the entire network as a single route means that riders transferring will not go through any fare validation. However, this is too general, and can be interpreted a a rider can get out at any station, walk to another station on a different line, and then get in without any form of fare processing. The specification needs to explicitly define exactly where riders can transfer without having to go through fare processing. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, we propose removing `routes.as_route` entirely and keeping `transfers.as_route` with the following changes: \r\n- Change the name to `within_fare_paid_zone`.\r\n- Change the description to \u201c*Indicates if the transfer for the specified `from_stop_id` and `to_stop_id` pair does not require any fare processing, payment, or validation*\u201d. \r\n- This would be at the network level, since GTFS-Fares v2 is centred around fare legs and networks. Additionally, these types of transfers are almost always restricted to transfers within the same network. Hence, we suggest adding a field for `network_id` that is required if this field is in use.\r\n\r\nThese changes do not contradict the rules in `fare_transfer_rules.txt` since they define how transfers are processed between different fare leg groups. Whereas this proposal adds a flag that transfers between routes at a given stop do not require fare processing (as if both routes behaved as a single route).\r\n\r\nPlease let us know your thoughts on these changes.\r\n",

    "body": "Hey everyone - this issue is on processing fares for transfers between different agencies. For example: riders with ticket A on agency#1 can transfer for free to agency#2. This is based on [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18yWhwR89pQp48VuBNPXK0djLXOtdjWhgC2h6jCC8WPM/edit#heading=h.bhbxvegn4na) by Transit.  \r\n\r\nThis requires adding two fields to `fare_leg_rules.txt` and `fare_transfer_rules`:\r\n- `filter_fare_product_id`: Indicates that this rule is in effect if a fare product is being used\r\n- `transfer_only`: Indicates that this rule is only considered if the rider transfers to this leg. This rule will not be considered if it matches the first leg of a rider's journey. \r\n\r\nTo keep this issue short, please refer to the proposal hyperlinked above for information on the files and fields in this proposal as well as an example.\r\n\r\nIt seems that `fare_leg_rules.txt` and `fare_transfer_rules.txt` cannot represent a use case where a certain leg cannot be travelled unless a previous condition has been met (in the example in the above proposal, a rider has travelled on the Goatville express). \r\n- Without the field `fare_leg_rules.transfer_only`, it is not possible to represent the fact that riders cannot travel on the Marmottown local using their Goatville express ticket **unless** they travelled on the Goatville express.\r\n- Without the field `fare_transfer_rules.filter_fare_product_id`, it is not possible to represent the fact that riders need to have a valid fare for the Goatville express to travel on the Marmottown local.  \r\n\r\nThe only action item would be to agree on the definitions and presence of `filter_fare_product_id` and `transfer_only` as well as the Primary Keys for `fare_leg_rules.txt` and `fare_transfer_rules.txt`.\r\n\r\n`fare_leg_rules.txt`:\r\n`transfer_only` (enum, Optional): *changed from bool to enum from the proposal)*\r\n- 1: This rule may only be considered if there is a matching fare transfer rule from the preceding leg to the current leg. A rule with `transfer_only=1` can never match the first leg of a journey.\r\n- 0 or unspecified:  This rule may be considered regardless of whether any transfer rules apply.\r\n\r\n`fare_transfer_rules.txt`:\r\n`filter_fare_product_id` (ID referencing `fare_products.fare_product_id`, Optional):\r\n- Identifies a valid and active fare product that a rider needs to be eligible for this transfer. \r\n\r\n`transfer_only` needs to be added to the Primary Keys for `fare_leg_rules.txt`.\r\n`filter_fare_product_id` needs to be added to the Primary Keys for `fare_transfer_rules.txt`.\r\n\r\nWe are happy to open a pull request for this issue if we can get consensus.",

    "body": "Hi everyone - we ([MobilityData](https://mobilitydata.org/)) are looking to add zone-based fares to GTFS as part of GTFS-Fares v2.\r\n\r\nThis requires the following changes:\r\n- Add the field `contains_area_id` to `fare_leg_rules.txt`\r\n- Add the field `greater_area_id` somewhere\r\n\r\nBelow is an example of how we envision the files and fields being used to describe zone-based fares. \r\n\r\n**Step 1: Define Zones**\r\n\r\nConsider a system with four zones; A, B, C, and D: \r\n- A \u2192 B costs 3 CAD\r\n- B \u2192 C costs 2 CAD\r\n- C \u2192 D costs 1 CAD\r\n- A \u2192 C (though B) costs 4.5 CAD\r\n- A \u2192 D (though B and C) costs 5.5 CAD\r\n\r\nUse `areas.txt` to create the fare zones:\r\n\r\n`areas.txt`\r\n| area_id | area_name |\r\n|--|--|\r\n| A | Area A |\r\n| B | Area B |\r\n| C | Area C |\r\n| D | Area D |\r\n\r\n**Step 2: Group zones**\r\n\r\nGrouping zones is necessary to describe zone-based fares that cross more than three zones. The origin zone is listed under `from_area_id`, the destination zone is listed under `to_area_id`, and the zones in between are grouped and listed under `contains_area_id`. In the [original proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19j-f-wZ5C_kYXmkLBye1g42U-kvfSVgYLkkG5oyBauY/edit#heading=h.mhjuwqk2h5r3), the file `stop_areas.txt` is used to to assign stops to areas and to group areas together using `greater_area_id`. However, this would probably get messy with three different layers being present in one file (stops, areas, and greater areas). \r\n\r\nOne option would be to have a new file to assign areas to greater areas:\r\n| area_id | greater_area_id |\r\n|--|--|\r\n|B|areaBC|\r\n|C|areaBC|\r\n\r\nAnother alternative would be to use the file `areas.txt` to assign areas to greater areas - the only downside to that is that an area cannot be assigned to more than one greater area.\r\n\r\n**Step 3: Define fare legs**\r\n\r\nUse `fare_leg_rules.txt` to define the cost of travel between the different zones:\r\n\r\n| from_area_id | to_area_id | contains_area_id | fare_product_id\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n| A | B | | 3_dollar |\r\n| B | C | | 2_dollar |\r\n| C | D | | 1_dollar |\r\n| A | C |B | 4.5_dollar |\r\n| A | D |BC | 5.5_dollar |\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on how this example models zone-based fares? Is this in line with the expectations of data consumers and data producers? We would also like to hear your suggestions around `greater_area_id`.\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts here so we can come up with a way to move forward with zone-based fares.",

All other factors are modelled in fare products. \r\n\r\n**_Here's a quick example_** \r\n- A regular fare is required to travel.\r\n- The fare is discounted if riders travel between 6:00 AM and 7:00 AM. \r\n- On New Year's, transit is free (no fare).\r\n\r\nDefine service days and New Year's using `calendar.txt.` and `calendar_dates.txt`\r\n| service_id | monday |tuesday  |wednesday |thursday |friday |saturday |sunday |start_date |end_date |\r\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n| regular_service | 1 |1  |1 |1 |1 |1 |1 |20230101 |20231231 |\r\n\r\n| service_id |date  |exception_type|\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n|regular_service  | 20230101 |2 |\r\n|new_year_service  | 20230101 |1 |\r\n\r\nDefine the discounted timeframe using `timeframes.txt`\r\n| timeframe_id |start_time  |end_time|\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n|morning  | 06:00:00 |07:00:00 |\r\n|regular  | 00:00:00 |05:59:59 |\r\n|regular  | 00:07:01 |23:59:59 |\r\n|all_day  | 00:00:00 |23:59:59 |\r\n\r\nDefine the time and date-based fares using `fare_leg_rules.txt`\r\n| leg_group_id | from_area_id |to_area_id  |network_id |from_timeframe_id |to_timeframe_id |service_id |fare_product|\r\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n| leg1| zoneA |zoneB  |bus |regular |all_day|regular_service |regular_fare |\r\n| leg1| zoneA |zoneB  |bus |morning |all_day|regular_service |discounted_fare |\r\n| leg1| zoneA |zoneB  |bus |regular |all_day|new_year_service |free_fare |\r\n| leg1| zoneA |zoneB  |bus |morning |all_day|new_year_service |free_fare |\r\n\r\nData consumer: [Apple](https://www.apple.com/)\r\nData producer:\u2028\u2028 (To be announced)\r\n\r\nPlease go through the changes and share your thoughts here!\r\nLooking forward to feedback and contribution on this proposal.\r\n\r\nFor other questions/concerns, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to [specifications@mobilitydata.org](mailto:specifications@mobilitydata.org).",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\u2028\u2028 MobilityData is moving forward with the second iteration of GTFS-Fares v2, for more information about the overall plan, you can check [this issue](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/341). \r\n\r\nThis pull request covers Fare Containers, which is a section of the entire [GTFS-Fares v2 proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19j-f-wZ5C_kYXmkLBye1g42U-kvfSVgYLkkG5oyBauY/edit#heading=h.mhjuwqk2h5r3). \r\n\r\nFare containers correspond to cards or mobile applications that are used to load and use fares. In many cases, fares loaded on a fare container are cheaper than fares purchased as individual tickets outside a fare container. \r\n\r\nThe changes in this pull request are:\r\n- Add new file; `fare_containers.txt`, to define new fare containers.\r\n- Extend `fare_products.txt` with `fare_container_id` to assign fare products to fare containers and to define the price of a fare if a fare container is used to pay.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of `fare_leg_rules.txt` and `fare_transfer_rules.txt` is unchanged as the cost of a fare leg or a transfer is tied to a fare product. The modelling of the cost of a one-way ticket purchased as a ticket vs. loaded on a fare container factors in `fare_products.txt`.\r\n\r\n**_Here's a quick example:_**\r\n- A fare container costs 5 CAD.\r\n- A fare is 3 CAD, however, if riders load the fare on their fare container and pay with it, a fare is 2.95 CAD.\r\n- Riders can transfer once - in a period of one hour - if they do not have a fare container, they will pay 0.05 CAD to transfer, however, if they transfer using their fare container, the transfer is free.\r\n\r\nDefine a fare container in `fare_containers.txt`\r\n|fare_container_id  | amount | currency|\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n| container | 5 | CAD|\r\n\r\nDefine the fare structure (paying for a fare with and without the fare container) in `fare_products.txt`\r\n|fare_product_id|fare_container_id  | amount | currency|\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n| single_leg |  | 3 | CAD|\r\n| single_leg | container | 2.95 | CAD|\r\n| transfer_cost |  | 0.05 | CAD|\r\n| transfer_cost | container | 0 | CAD|\r\n\r\nDefine fare legs using `fare_leg_rules.txt`\r\n|leg_group_id|from_area_id|to_area_id | network_id| fare_product_id | \r\n|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n|leg1| zoneA | zoneB | bus | single_leg|\r\n\r\nDefine transfer rules using `fare_transfer_rules.txt`\r\n|from_leg_group_id|to_leg_group_id|transfer_count | duration_limit| duration_limit_type |fare_transfer_type|fare_product_id| \r\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n|leg1|leg1|1 | 3600| 0 |0|transfer_cost| \r\n\r\nData consumer: [Apple](https://www.apple.com/)\r\nData producer:\u2028\u2028 [Interline](https://www.interline.io/)\r\n\r\nPlease go through the changes and share your thoughts here!\r\nLooking forward to feedback and contribution on this proposal. \r\n\r\nFor other questions/concerns, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to [specifications@mobilitydata.org](mailto:specifications@mobilitydata.org).",

    "body": "## Update on GTFS-Fares v2\r\n\r\nHello everyone, this issue is to present MobilityData's next steps on GTFS-Fares v2 to keep the community updated as well as to hear everyone's thoughts on this. \r\n\r\nWe are very happy to announce that MobilityData will continue working on GTFS-Fares v2 by adding more functionalities into the specification. This comes as a successor to the [base implementation](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/286), which added fare legs, fare areas, complex transfers, and tickets. We are now working on the second implementation of GTFS-Fares v2, which covers the following features:\r\n\r\n-  Variable pricing by time of day, or by day of week, month, or year\r\n-  Fare containers  \r\n-  Allowing multiple routes to behave as a single route (transfer rules ignored)\r\n-  Zone-based fares\r\n-  Inter-agency transfers (using fare_leg_rules.transfer_only, proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18yWhwR89pQp48VuBNPXK0djLXOtdjWhgC2h6jCC8WPM/edit#heading=h.bhbxvegn4na))\r\n    \r\n\r\nThe data producer and consumer for the second implementation of GTFS-Fares v2 are:\r\n-   Consumer: [Apple](https://www.apple.com/)\r\n-   Producer: [Interline](https://www.interline.io/)\r\n\r\n### Timeline:\r\n\r\nWe are planning to open separate pull requests for features that do not overlap to keep focus on the discussions and facilitate the consensus building process.\r\n\r\n**Week of August 1:**\r\n\r\nOpen pull requests for:\r\n\r\n - [x] Variable pricing by time of day, or by day of week, month, or year\r\n - [x] Fare containers\r\n\r\nThe above two features are straightforward, and MobilityData does not foresee any challenges to reaching consensus within the community. We are comfortable with opening pull requests and going through the GTFS change process leading up to a vote at this time. \r\n\r\nFor the remaining features, more time is needed for conversations to close out open issues and come to consensus. Hence, below is the plan for moving forward with regards to these features:\r\n \r\nOpen GitHub issues for:\r\n\r\n - [x] Allowing multiple routes to behave as a single route (transfer rules ignored)\r\n - [x] Zone-based fares\r\n - [x] Inter-agency transfers (using fare_leg_rules.transfer_only, proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18yWhwR89pQp48VuBNPXK0djLXOtdjWhgC2h6jCC8WPM/edit#heading=h.bhbxvegn4na))\r\n\r\n**Week of August 8:**\r\n\r\n- Discussions with the community on the three open GitHub issues.\r\n\r\n**Week of August 15:** \r\n\r\n- MobilityData will share a summary of the GitHub discussions.\r\n\r\n**Week of August 22:** \r\n\r\n- If the items are still unresolved, MobilityData will host three meetings with interested stakeholders to close them out. Full details on the days and times of the meetings will be posted in each issue.\r\n\r\n**Week of August 29:**\r\n\r\n- MobilityData will share a summary outlining the outcomes from the stakeholder meetings. \r\n\r\n**Week of September 05:**\r\n\r\n- For the issues that have been resolved, MobilityData will open pull requests and go through the GTFS change process leading to a vote.\r\n\r\n**Week of September 12:** \r\n\r\n- If there still are unresolved issues, MobilityData will facilitate another round of community discussions to close out any outstanding issues.\r\n\r\n**Week of September 19:** \r\n\r\n- MobilityData will share a summary outlining the outcomes from the stakeholder meetings. If the issues have been resolved, MobilityData will open pull requests and go through the GTFS change process leading to a vote.",

    "body": "This issue relates to the GTFS-Flex proposal, and is opened following a series of roundtable discussion to resolve the outstanding issues with the proposal. These discussions were hosted by MobilityData and attended by various stakeholders within the GTFS community.\r\n\r\nYou can find the GTFS-Flex proposal here: [https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-flex/blob/master/spec/reference.md](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-flex/blob/master/spec/reference.md)  \r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThe file `locations.geojson` is based on the [geoJSON format defined by RFC 7946](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946).\r\nIn the current GTFS-Flex proposal, the file `locations.geojson` is structured as follows:\r\n\r\n> - Type (always set to FeatureCollection)\r\n> - Features\r\n>   - type (Always set to Feature)\r\n>   - id (Unique ID to describe the location)\r\n>   - properties (These properties match how stops are described in stops.txt)\r\n>     - stop_name (Text name) \r\n>     - stop_desc (Text description)\r\n>     - zone_id (In case of Fares v1)\r\n>     - stop_url (URL)\r\n>   - Geometry\r\n>     - Type (Options are: Point, MultiPoint, Linestring, MutiLineString, Polygon, and MultiPolygon)\r\n>     - coordinates (Array of coordinates) \r\n\r\nIt is possible to simplify `locations.geojson` and to tailor it to GTFS-Flex while remaining compliant with RFC 7946. We propose the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Make the file `locations.geojson` lighter\r\n  - Remove `properties` and all fields that fall under it (those will be described in `stops.txt`)\r\n  - Remove `Point`, `MultiPoint`, `Linestring`, and `MutiLineString` from the list of options for `Geometry.Type` since there is no need to define points or lines in `locations.geojson`\r\n- Use the file `locations.geojson` to create the zone (ID and geometry)\r\n- Use the file `stops.txt` to associate attributes to the zone (`stop_name`, `stop_desc`, `zone_id`, `stop_url`, and others)\r\n\r\nThis means that zones are created in `locations.geojson`, and then listed with all other stops in `stops.txt` to associate attributes to the zone (some fields such as `stops.stop_lat` and `stops.stop_lon` will be forbidden when a record in `stops.txt` corresponds to a zone)\r\n\r\nThe advantages to doing this are:\r\n\r\n1. Stops and zones will be listed in the same file instead of multiple files\r\n2. Changes to the spec that relate to the attributes of stops and zones will only affect `stops.txt` (no need to maintain field parity with `locations.geojson`)\r\n\r\nWith these changes, the file `locations.geojson` will be structured as follows:\r\n\r\n> - Type (always set to FeatureCollection)\r\n> - Features\r\n>   - type (Always set to Feature)\r\n>   - id (Unique ID to describe the location)\r\n>   - Geometry\r\n>     - Type (Polygon, MultiPolygon)\r\n>     - coordinates (array of coordinates) \r\n\r\nIf there is a general consensus on proceeding with this option, we can post a proposal of how to modify the files and fields in `stops.txt` (and other files like `transfers.txt`, `pathways.txt`, `levels.txt`, and `fare_leg_rules.txt`) to accommodate GeoJSON locations.",

The values must increase along the trip but do not need to be consecutive.\r\n\r\nThis also might not be very intuitive/human readable since a trip within the same zone is not described in two records (from - to)\r\nTo address this, one option is to require two records in `stop_times.txt` to describe travel within a single zone, for example:\r\n\r\n**`stop_times.txt`**\r\n|trip_id|stop_id|stop_sequence|start_pickup_dropoff_window|end_pickup_dropoff_window|pickup_type|drop_off_type|\r\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\nOnDemand|ZoneA|1|08:00:00|20:00:00|2|2\r\nOnDemand|ZoneA|2|08:00:00|20:00:00|2|2\r\n\r\nThe above example makes the specification more explicit (travel within ZoneA means a trip from ZoneA to ZoneA) which leaves less room for ambiguity.\r\n\r\nAn example of this ambiguity is that currently, if a service allows riders to travel within the same zone, data producers can either use one record in `stop_times.txt`, or can use two records (from ZoneA to ZoneA). There is nothing in the spec to prevent one of the options. \r\n\r\nAdditional complexities may arise when modeling intercity buses, which allow riders to travel from one zone to another, but forbid them from traveling within the same zone. \r\nWith the current GTFS-Flex proposal, these services can be described in more than one way:\r\n\r\n1. Using a single record in `stop_times.txt` alongside multiple trips ([see example](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-flex/issues/65#issuecomment-954860605))\r\n2. Using two records in `stop_times.txt` (the first forbids pickups but allows drop offs and the second permits pickups and forbids drop offs)\r\n\r\nThe proposal to forbid travel within the same record in `stop_times.txt`, and thus always requiring two records to define travel could eliminate these ambiguities in the specification.",

It will be possible to have different transit services represented in a single GTFS file.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is a need to delineate which types of services are represented in a GTFS dataset. We propose these four options:\r\n\r\n- Fixed route service\r\n- On-demand service\r\n- Deviated fixed route service\r\n- Hybrid service (combination of the above services that varies by time such as a fixed route accepts deviation requests during off-peak hours only)\r\n\r\nTo avoid the complexities of adding new fields to GTFS, we are proposing a process to parse the files and fields in GTFS to determine the type of services represented in the dataset.\r\n\r\nThis is the link to the flowchart: [GTFS-Flex Decision Tree](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12FIdBqJEE-h6B1sJ0lyIq_eCTkLwWYTIhDtLN3j8L9c/edit)\r\n\r\nPlease provide your feedback on the process here - as well as your thoughts on where this diagram should live. We propose having it in the [GTFS Schedule Best Practices page](https://gtfs.org/schedule/best-practices/).",

    "body": "**Background:**\r\n\r\nTransit agencies use different language when describing the effect of an alert. For example, when there is a rail suspension some agencies prefer saying 'bus bridge' while others prefer 'shuttle'. As another example, some agencies use the spelling \u2018cancellation\u2019 while others use \u2018cancelation\u2019 to describe trip or service cancellations. In addition, transit agencies may require more effects than those defined in the GTFS-realtime specification to describe the impact of their alerts. The specification currently allows for 12 enum values that correspond with different effects (see [here](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#enum-effect)). However, each of these values may correspond with more than one effect used by an agency. For example, a stop closure, suspension, and trip cancellation may all map to the NO_SERVICE effect in the specification.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, an agency may use more causes than those defined in the GTFS-realtime specification for the Cause field (see [here](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#enum-cause)). For example, causes like a fire, disabled bus, or mechanical issue could all correspond to the TECHNICAL_PROBLEM cause in the specification.\r\n\r\nThese limitations may keep transit agencies from being able to programmatically create alerts between two systems. For example, to automatically create alerts in an alert management system, causes and effects would need to be restricted to a one-to-one relationship between those used to describe alerts and those in the GTFS-realtime specification. These limitations also prevent consumers from using more granular effect and cause names when displaying or grouping alerts. For example, we have worked with transit agencies who prefer prominently showing \"Stop Closure\" for an alert on their website rather than \"No Service\" as would be communicated by the existing effect field.\r\n\r\n**Alternatives:**\r\n\r\nSummary of alternative options, and why they are insufficient:\r\n\r\n1. Add new enum values to cause and effect in the GTFS-realtime specification. \r\n   1. This still limits data producers to a specific set of causes and effects, and as noted above agencies each use specific language when communicating to customers. Also, the timeline for proposing, debating, and voting on new enum values (and the chance that new enum values will not be unanimously approved) is a barrier to this option.\r\n\r\n2. Use existing effect options plus the collection of selected affected entities to determine a more granular effect than allowed by existing enums. \r\n   1. For example, a route-direction-trip level NO_SERVICE alert is most likely a trip cancellation. \r\n   2. More than one effect may correspond to the same effect/affected entity combination. For example, a route-direction-stop DETOUR alert may be either a detour or a snow route.",

    "body": "The purpose of this pull request is to clarify the existing intent and predominant usage for `stop_times.arrival_time` and `stop_times.departure_time` and (in conjunction) `agency.timezone` and `stops.stop_timezone`.\r\n\r\n## Affected use cases:\r\n\r\n1. Services with stops outside of `agency.timezone`\r\n2. Trips which span midnight and/or daylight savings time implementation time (2AM).\r\n\r\n## Current Practice\r\n\r\nCurrent [stop_times.arrival_time](http://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#stop_timestxt) definition:\r\n\r\n> Arrival time at a specific stop for a specific trip on a route. If there are not separate times for arrival and departure at a stop, enter the same value for arrival_time and departure_time. For times occurring after midnight on the service day, enter the time as a value greater than 24:00:00 in HH:MM:SS *local time* for the day on which the trip schedule begins.\r\n\r\nThe above definition, with use of the word \"local\" implies that stop_times.txt should use the time zone of the local stop.  However, the `stop.stop_timezone` definition clearly states that if used, that `stop_times` should refer to `agency.agency_timezone`. \r\n\r\n### Example Timezone Problem\r\nAmtrak's Southwest Chief Route travels between Kingman AZ (KNG) and Needles CA (NDL):\r\n\r\nAmtrak has implemented the following: \r\n\r\n`agency.agency_timezone` is set to Eastern\r\n`stops.stop_timezone` is set to Mountain for KNG and Pacific for NDL\r\n`stop_times.departure_time` for KNG is specified as 12:28 AM (Mountain Time)\r\n`stop_times.arrival_time` for NDL is specified as 12:26 AM (Pacific Time)\r\n\r\n...which results in:\r\n\r\n1.  GTFS validator giving a too-fast travel warning ([See this issue in the GTFS Validator Repository](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/issues/1110)\r\n2. Incorrect implementation for GTFS consumers (Google has confirmed that it uses `agency.timezone`\r\n\r\n### Example Daylight Savings Problem\r\n(from @npaum - please feel free to correct my excerpt!)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"668\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/794787/168169746-18fcda0a-41a1-4ca2-b92c-dcf5eb576585.png\">\r\n\r\n- It is impossible to express the time \"Nov 6 00:00\" as part of the Nov 6 service day, unless negative hours are used. The specification never clearly defines or prohibits this practice.\r\n\r\n- Consider a shuttle that runs once an hour on :15 past the hour, every day of the week. One could use this very simple schedule for the entire year:\r\n<img width=\"72\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/794787/168169833-1d0ef52e-8038-4894-9221-3364737bd6d0.png\">\r\n\r\n- This would actually create two duplicative trips on \"Mar 12 23:15\". When DST ends, it would skip the \"Nov 6 00:15\" run.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\n\r\n1. Clarify definition of `time`, `arrival_time` and `departure_time` \r\n2. Clarify how `agency.timezone` and `stop.stop_timezone` are used \r\n\r\n\r\nFixes #322 #325",

In which case, there is no stated logic over which translation should take preference. This leads to a situation where the data consumer needs to make a discretionary choice, behavior that is not desired.

    "body": "In GTFS, specifying trip schedules during the transition into and out of daylight savings time is complex. \r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nGiven the definition of time provided in the specification,\r\n\r\n> Time in the HH:MM:SS format (H:MM:SS is also accepted). The time is measured from \"noon minus 12h\" of the service day (effectively midnight except for days on which daylight savings time changes occur). For times occurring after midnight, enter the time as a value greater than 24:00:00 in HH:MM:SS local time for the day on which the trip schedule begins.\r\n> Example: 14:30:00 for 2:30PM or 25:35:00 for 1:35AM on the next day.\r\n\r\nApplying this rule to the date DST begins (March 13, 2022 in my region) and the date it ends (Nov 6, 2022), we obtain the following chart:\r\n\r\n### Table 1\r\n\r\n| DST Begins     |                              | DST Ends      |                              |\r\n|----------------|------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------|\r\n| **GTFS time**  | **Date represented**         | **GTFS time** | **Date represented**         |\r\n| N/A            | N/A                          | -01:00        | Sun Nov  6 00:00:00 PDT 2022 |\r\n| 00:00          | Sat Mar 12 23:00:00 PST 2022 |  00:00        | Sun Nov  6 01:00:00 PDT 2022 |\r\n| 01:00          | Sun Mar 13 00:00:00 PST 2022 |  01:00        | Sun Nov  6 01:00:00 PST 2022 |\r\n| 02:00          | Sun Mar 13 01:00:00 PST 2022 | 02:00         | Sun Nov  6 02:00:00 PST 2022 |\r\n| 03:00          | Sun Mar 13 03:00:00 PDT 2022 | 03:00         | Sun Nov  6 03:00:00 PST 2022 |\r\n| 04:00          | Sun Mar 13 04:00:00 PDT 2022 | 04:00         | Sun Nov  6 04:00:00 PST 2022 |\r\n| 05:00          | Sun Mar 13 05:00:00 PDT 2022 | 05:00         | Sun Nov  6 05:00:00 PST 2022 |\r\n| 06:00          | Sun Mar 13 06:00:00 PDT 2022 | 06:00         | Sun Nov  6 06:00:00 PST 2022 |\r\n| 07:00          | Sun Mar 13 07:00:00 PDT 2022 | 07:00         | Sun Nov  6 07:00:00 PST 2022 |\r\n| 08:00          | Sun Mar 13 08:00:00 PDT 2022 | 08:00         | Sun Nov  6 08:00:00 PST 2022 |\r\n| 09:00          | Sun Mar 13 09:00:00 PDT 2022 | 09:00         | Sun Nov  6 09:00:00 PST 2022 |\r\n| 10:00          | Sun Mar 13 10:00:00 PDT 2022 | 10:00         | Sun Nov  6 10:00:00 PST 2022 |\r\n| 11:00          | Sun Mar 13 11:00:00 PDT 2022 | 11:00         | Sun Nov  6 11:00:00 PST 2022 |\r\n| 12:00          | Sun Mar 13 12:00:00 PDT 2022 | 12:00         | Sun Nov  6 12:00:00 PST 2022 |\r\n\r\nThis has some unusual implications, which I am not certain are understood in the same way by all data producers and consumers.\r\n\r\n* It is impossible to express the time \"Nov 6 00:00\" as part of the Nov 6 service day, unless negative hours are used. The specification never clearly defines or prohibits this practice.\r\n\r\n* Consider a shuttle that runs once an hour on :15 past the hour, every day of the week. One could use this very simple schedule for the entire year:\r\n\r\n| Time  |\r\n|-------|\r\n| 00:15 |\r\n| 01:15 |\r\n| ...   |\r\n| 22:15 |\r\n| 23:15 |\r\n\r\nBut this would actually create two duplicative trips on \"Mar 12 23:15\". When DST ends, it would skip the \"Nov 6 00:15\" run. Unfortunately, I've rarely encountered producers creating special services for the DST transition days.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\n* Producers: How do you model your data during the those special hours when the DST transition is occurring? Aside from GTFS, how are service changes during those times communicated to riders?\r\n* Consumers: Have you run into issues with DST while processing data, and do you use any workarounds internally?\r\n\r\n## Potential changes\r\n\r\nTo reduce confusion, the specification could state that all trips during the DST transition (e.g. `00:00-03:00 Mar 13` this year in my timezone) shall be ignored. Producers would be required to use times between `24:00-27:00 Mar 12` instead. However, this is just a starting point for discussion and I hope that we can collaborate to find a good solution to this problem as a community.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For times occurring after midnight on the service day, enter the time as a value greater than 24:00:00 in HH:MM:SS *local time* for the day on which the trip schedule begins.\r\n\r\nThe above definition, with use of the word \"local\" implies that stop_times.txt should use the time zone of the local stop.

    "body": "# Uniqueness of `fare_product_id`\r\n\r\nThis GitHub issue was raised in response to a discussion in https://github.com/google/transit/pull/286, and has been prioritized by MobilityData, who is going to work on it with the agenda described below. MobilityData is trying this format to resolve open issues with GTFS extensions - if you have any feedback regarding this format, please reach out to [specifications@mobilitydata.org](mailto:specifications@mobilitydata.org). \r\n\r\n## The need\r\nA clear way to model how fare products work for different rider categories (for example: the cost of the same one way ticket, but for adults, seniors, students, etc.).\r\n\r\n## The issue\r\nNo agreement on how this is modeled in `fare_products.txt`.\r\n\r\n## Potential options\r\n- Option 1: Make the field `fare_products.fare_product_id` unique - so the same `fare_product_id` cannot be used in more than one record. For this, a different `fare_product_id` is required for each instance. For example: \r\n\r\n| `fare_product_id` | `rider_category` | `amount`| `currency`|\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n|one_way_ticket_adult  |adult  | 3| CAD |\r\n| one_way_ticket_senior | senior | 2.5| CAD|\r\n\r\n- Option 2: Make the field `fare_products.fare_product_id` not unique - so that the same `fare_product_id` can be used in more than one record. For this, one `fare_product_id` is required per fare product, however, multiple records with the same `fare_product_id` define the different costs for different rider categories. For example: \r\n\r\n| `fare_product_id` | `rider_category` | `amount`| `currency`|\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n|one_way_ticket  |adult  | 3| CAD |\r\n| one_way_ticket | senior | 2.5| CAD|\r\n\r\n## Recommendation:\r\nEven though this will not directly affect the base implementation of GTFS-Fares v2, this affects the future modeling of `fare_products.txt`. MobilityData recommends Option 2. This serves the following benefits:\r\n\r\n- Keeps the data lighter by only requiring one `fare_product_id` per fare product\r\n- Keeps `fare_leg_rules.txt` significantly lighter by only requiring one record to define a leg with one `fare_product_id` instead of multiple records; each with a different `fare_product_id`\r\n- Provides the flexibility to enable data producers to produce data with unique `fare_products.fare_product_id`s if needed and express the fare legs explicitly in `fare_leg_rules.txt`",

    "body": "We have an issue as a data producer and consumer. (Our customer information tools are all built around our GTFS data.) \r\n\r\nWhen detours and stop closures are not reflected in the schedule data (i.e., closed stops are included in stop_times.txt), we close the stop via a ServiceAlert. It\u2019s straightforward that the closed stop_id\u2019s can be noted as informed_entity\u2019s, the schedule_relationship in TripUpdates is skipped, etc. \r\n\r\nIdeally, however, we want planned detours & stop closures to be reflected in schedule data. Trip plans, schedules, and real-time predictions are more accurate within our own tools and in other apps when the static files reflect the patterns the buses will actually travel and the stops the buses will actually serve. \r\n\r\nSince it is still a detour (even though it\u2019s in the schedule), we need to provide the Alert information. The challenge we have is that the alert gets updated so that the informed_entity is the route, since the closed stops are no longer referenced in stop_times.txt. \r\n\r\nWe tried retaining the stops in stops.txt while removing them from stop_times.txt to keep the alert more targeted, but that was a deal-breaker for a major consumer using our realtime feeds at all. If there was consensus on that approach it would solve part of our issue \u2013 it\u2019s hard to parse a long list of route-level alerts \u2013 but it would leave some gaps.  \r\n\r\n**These are our goals**:  \r\n1. When a customer requests real-time information for closed stop_id, or is at a stop with a real-time sign configured to display information for that stop_id, they get the relevant alert information. In order to achieve this, we need the alert to reference the closed stops in some way. \r\n2.   Alert information is geographically targeted to any temporary stops and the stops before and after the detour (i.e., the places a customer may be directed to if their normal stop is closed). When a customer plans a trip directing them to a temporary stop or the alternate stop before/after the detour, the alert shows up. When a customer plans a trip elsewhere on the route, the irrelevant alert is not displayed. Customers do not need to parse a long list of alerts that may not impact them.  \r\n\r\n**This is the approach we are considering:** \r\nWhen detours are reflected in the schedule data, update the alert so: \r\n-\tThe stops before and after the detour and any temporary stops created as part of the detour are the new informed entities \r\n-\tThe effect isn\u2019t \u201cDETOUR\u201d but \u201cOTHER\u201d (so it\u2019s clear that these stops shouldn\u2019t be skipped) \r\n-\tAdding a new field where closed stops can be listed (maybe \u201cclosed_stops\u201d) \r\n-\tRetaining these closed_stops in stops.txt for reference  \r\n\r\n### Example\r\n**BEFORE / UN-SCHEDULED DETOUR** \r\n\r\n> \u201ceffect\u201d: \u201cDETOUR \r\n> \"informed_entity\": [\r\n>           {\r\n>             \"agency_id\": \"0\",\r\n>             \"route_type\": 3,\r\n>             \"route_id\": \"18\",\r\n>             \"stop_id\": \"12345\",  [<--- THIS IS THE CLOSED STOP]\r\n>             \"direction_id\": 1,\r\n\r\n**AFTER / DETOUR IN SCHEDULE** \r\n\r\n>  \u201ceffect\u201d: \u201cOTHER\u201d \r\n> \"informed_entity\": [\r\n>           {\r\n>             \"agency_id\": \"0\",\r\n>             \"route_type\": 3,\r\n>             \"route_id\": \"18\",\r\n>             \"stop_id\": \"12344\u201d  [<-- This would be for regular route stops before and after detour and any temporary stops] \r\n>             \"direction_id\": 1,\r\n>  \t\u201cclosed_stops:\u201d \u201c19294\u201d\r\n\r\n**Feedback**\r\nHave others dealt with this issue?

    "body": "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nBaltimore's Light Rail service is MTA Maryland's last remaining transit mode without a public-facing GTFS-RT feed. Our goal is to launch a feed that, even during significant service disruptions, could populate passenger-facing trip planning applications as well as the digital signage on our train platforms. Consistent, accurate, standardized information everywhere is totally the goal here.\r\nUnfortunately, we are now under the impression that the GTFS and GTFS-RT spec today can not adequately describe two extremely common scenarios on our Light Rail service:\r\n\r\n1. \"Short turns\" / \"turn backs\" / \"end closure\" scenarios: Characterized by one or more stations closed to revenue service extending out from a route terminus point where trains normally turn around to end one trip and begin another.\r\n2. \"System split\" scenarios: Characterized by one or more stations closed to revenue service that are surrounded by stations that are open to revenue service. Trains are forced to short turn in two different locations where they are not normally scheduled to do so, effectively splitting one \"line\" in to two separate \"lines\" with potentially different headways (though they share the same route name).\r\n\r\nLooking through the static and RT documentation, we hoped that we could use DUPLICATED trips that were pre-defined in the GTFS to describe different segments of our system to then pull them in to the RT feed whenever necessary. We tested out a handful of approaches, such as defining those trips as occurring \"in the past\" or \"exactly 29 days in the future at all times\". We've now come to understand that DUPLICATED really seems to be intended for additional \"tripper\" types of situations, and not for describing more advanced scenarios.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, our team likes the idea of being able to define trips part of an \"on-call\" service_ID within the calendar.txt where all days = 0 as a relatively simple way to define dynamic changes in a lot of different use cases (snow routes, reduced commuter services, bus bridges, rail system splits and short turns, etc.) and imagine it could also cut down on the amount of data necessary in the RT feeds. I'm not sure where the ServiceChanges proposal stands today now that DUPLICATED trips and encoded polyline DETOURs are accepted experimental features, but I imagine that describing the types of services listed above through the static GTFS could be valuable in terms of data transfer / size of RT feeds as well as simplicity for the spec? Just throwing ideas out there, of course - that's why we're asking :)\r\n\r\nEssentially, we'd like to pose these questions to the greater community, as we'd really like to launch RT on our Light Rail service as soon as possible - but are striving to utilize GTFS to the greatest capacity available.\r\n\r\n1. Has anyone been able to describe these types of rail disruptions (short turns, system splits) within the spec as it stands today? If so, how?\r\n2. Does anyone have thoughts on what might be immediately next for the spec that could address these types of disruptions, and what might be further away from a production standpoint?\r\n\r\nAnd of course, in general, would love to hear any producer / consumer / other agency thoughts on any/all the above. Thanks in advance!",

    "body": "GTFS currently allows producers to define two general types of service:\r\n1. **schedule-based trips** that adhere to a schedule - GTFS datasets without frequencies.txt, or with frequencies.txt that have records defined with `exact_times = 1`.\r\n2. **frequency-based trips** that operate based on a headway and not a fixed schedule - GTFS datasets with frequencies.txt and no `exact_times` column, or with frequencies.txt that have records defined with `exact_times = 0`.\r\n\r\nYou could also break down frequency-based trips into two subtypes, although GTFS doesn't currently have a way to distinguish between the two:\r\n1. **Unmanaged** - The vehicles are dispatched to start the trip, but after the start the vehicle is not managed by dispatch and will attempt to adhere to the timing between stops defined by stop_times.txt. As a result, bus-bunching can occur mid-way through a trip served by multiple vehicles because if a downstream vehicle is delayed the upstream vehicle will not adjust it's timing. However, the start time of the next dispatched vehicle could be pushed back depending on the conditions of the vehicles currently serving the route.\r\n1. **Managed** - The vehicles are continuously managed by dispatch in an attempt to adhere to the defined headway throughout the trip so riders waiting at stops see vehicles arrive at the defined headway. This approach should be better at avoiding bus-bunching because if a downstream vehicle is delayed the upstream vehicle will be held mid-trip in an attempt to space out the vehicles arriving at stops.\tJeffrey Tumlin from SFMTA posted an [excellent 4 minute SFMTA staff training video](https://youtu.be/SYcwLv1jkSk) as part of [a Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/jeffreytumlin/status/1265481569747136512) that describes how SFMTA provides managed service.\r\n\r\nThere has been confusion over the behavior of [timepoints](https://gtfs.org/reference/static#stop_timestxt) in GTFS and [delays](https://gtfs.org/reference/realtime/v2/#message-stoptimeevent) in GTFS Realtime with true frequency-based service (exact_times=0), which I believe largely stems from the above two different types of frequency-based service.\r\n\r\nHere's my understanding of how these field could (should/must?) work for each:\r\n1. **Unmanaged** - `timepoint` could be set to `1` to indicate that these are the stops that the vehicle will try to adhere to after they are dispatched at the start of the trip (similar to the definition for scheduled service). `delay` could indicate how early/late a vehicle is running based on the start time and attempt to adhere to the timing between stops defined by stop_times.txt.\r\n1. **Managed** - `timepoint` values must not be set to `1` because no times are exact - `timepoint` must be `0`. `delay` must not be allowed in GTFS Realtime, because there is no fixed schedule time to compare the delay against. `time` must be used instead.\r\n\r\nPersonally I have a stronger understanding/opinion of how these fields work for \"managed\" trips, but I'm open to feedback for both.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n1. Does anyone agree or disagree with the above, or have alternate interpretations?\r\n2. Do you think we should add two different types of frequency-based service in GTFS so producers can indicate which they are operating (exact_times=2 and 3)?\r\n\r\nIf you're an operator of frequency-based service, it would be great if you could chime in and say if you operate managed or unmanaged frequency-based service and also share how you represent your data in GTFS and GTFS Realtime.\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\n- **gtfs-realtime-validator** - delay values for exact_times=0 trips - https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-realtime-validator/issues/64\r\n- **gtfs-valdator** - timepoints for exact_times=0 trips - https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator/pull/887#issuecomment-832326343\r\n- **GTFS Realtime spec** - Clarification: Trip schedule_relationship and start_time for UNSCHEDULED trips - https://github.com/google/transit/pull/301/files#r821231116\r\n- **GTFS timepoint definition clarification** - https://github.com/google/transit/issues/61\r\n\r\ncc @IvanVolosyuk",

That is, the spec should include information that can help power tools for riders, first and foremost. There is potentially a large amount of operations-oriented information that transit agencies might want to transmit internally between systems. GTFS Realtime is not intended for that purpose and there are potentially other operations-oriented data-standards that may be more appropriate.\r\n\r\nThis pull request copies the same guiding principle from GTFS Realtime to GTFS and updates the wording accordingly.\r\n\r\nI think there is a legitimate debate over whether this should still be a guiding principle for GTFS, although I'd prefer to have that discussion in a separate issue. \r\n\r\nIMHO it's pretty clear from the existing text that this guiding principle is intended for GTFS as well, and this changes focuses on making that clear to readers of the GTFS docs that don't review the GTFS Realtime documentation.",

    "body": "## Customer Need\r\n\r\n*On behalf of Amtrak...*\r\n\r\n*As a customer, I'd like to know (and potentially select a route by) if I can expect the bus route I've chosen to provide a comfortable amount of space to sit and some space for my personal items - so that I can evaluate if it is an appropriate route for me or if is worth any difference in costs.*\r\n\r\n*As a customer, I'd like to know (and potentially select a route by) if I can expect the bus route I've chosen to requires me to navigate across vehicle rows where I cannot stand and sit, next to individuals that I may not know without the option to move during the trip - so that I can evaluate if it is an appropriate route for me (my ability and comfort level in being in close proximity to others) or if is worth any difference in costs.*\r\n\r\n## Current Spec\r\n\r\n[`routes.route_type`](https://gtfs.org/reference/static#routestxt) :\r\n> Indicates the type of transportation used on a route. Valid options are:\r\n> \r\n> 0 - Tram, Streetcar, Light rail. Any light rail or street level system within a metropolitan area.\r\n> 1 - Subway, Metro. Any underground rail system within a metropolitan area.\r\n> 2 - Rail. Used for intercity or long-distance travel.\r\n> 3 - Bus. Used for short- and long-distance bus routes.\r\n> 4 - Ferry. Used for short- and long-distance boat service.\r\n> 5 - Cable tram. Used for street-level rail cars where the cable runs beneath the vehicle, e.g., cable car in San Francisco.\r\n> 6 - Aerial lift, suspended cable car (e.g., gondola lift, aerial tramway). Cable transport where cabins, cars, gondolas or open chairs are suspended by means of one or more cables.\r\n> 7 - Funicular. Any rail system designed for steep inclines.\r\n> 11 - Trolleybus. Electric buses that draw power from overhead wires using poles.\r\n> 12 - Monorail. Railway in which the track consists of a single rail or a beam\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solutions\r\n\r\n#### 1. Add `coach` as a `route_type` | Update `bus`\r\n\r\n3:  Bus, \r\n- customers may be seated or standing\r\n- differentiated from a van by customers being able to navigate across rows via an aisle that is standing-height\r\n\r\n9: Coach, \r\n- a bus with premium features such as:  \r\n  - more comfortable, dedicated seating. \r\n -  May or may not include: space underneath and above the rider for luggage, individual climate control, on-board restrooms, entertainment, and connectivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 2. Add `van` as a `route_type`\r\n\r\n\r\n8 : van, a slightly larger auto where \r\n- a single or pair of doors provides access to multiple rows of seats, access to which is typically provided via a small side aisle or folding seats. \r\n- Interior ceiling is below typical standing height. \r\n\r\n#### 3. Add `BRT` as `route_type`\r\n\r\n10: Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), a bus service (bus, coach, or electric trolleybus) with supporting infrastructure designed to improve travel time and service reliability where: \r\n- all or a significant portion of the route operates on dedicated transit right-of-way; \r\n- dwell times are minimized through strategies such as all-door-boarding, ticket pre-payment, and level-boarding;   and\r\n- travel times are enhanced using strategies such as transit signal priority or higher-speed roadway design.\r\n\r\nBRT may or may not include enhancements to:  \r\n- customer communication and branding;  and \r\n- on- and off-board rider amenities. \r\n\r\nWe could also just reference: [\"What is BRT\"](https://www.itdp.org/library/standards-and-guides/the-bus-rapid-transit-standard/what-is-brt/), ITDP\r\n\r\n## Previous discussion\r\n\r\n#174 considered several additional `route_type` values and settled on adding one for monorail and one for trolleybus.  There is a lot of great discussion in the issue thread that is worth reviewing.\r\n - Intercity bus/coach was not added at the time due to concerns that it was:\r\n    -  Potentially not backwards compatible because many feeds currently code intercity bus as bus\r\n        - *I see this is non-breaking because old versions of the feed would still \"make sense\" to users and would not fail validation*\r\n        - *Arguably trolleybus would have had the same issue?*\r\n    -  Lack of specificity in the definition of intercity bus\r\n        - *I think we can get to a good definition.*\r\n\r\nI am unaware of any previous discussions about \"vans\" (vs autos) but would welcome them.  \r\n\r\n## Relevant Pull Requests\r\n\r\n#279 has the text for all previous proposed extended route types\r\n\r\n## Relevant open proposals\r\n\r\nThe following proposals are also relevant:\r\n\r\n- [GTFS-Vehicles](http://bit.ly/gtfs-vehicles)  \r\n  - proposes very granular features available on various vehicle types.  \r\n  - **This proposal does not inhibit any of the GTFS-Vehicles proposal**\r\n- [GTFS-ModesAndNetworks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qWFZ8bYD0d4CVtNfXjzKyq3nBYEGIoDZREayseDnrok/edit#) \r\n  - Considers additional expansion of `route_type` and grouping of routes and route types into networks and modes.  \r\n  - **This proposal does not inhibit any of the GTFS-ModesAndNetworks proposal** and provides a lower-effort shortcut to achieve several of its basic user needs.\r\n- [GTFS-OnDemand](https://bit.ly/gtfs-ondemand) \r\n  - Proposes the addition of an enum value for car/auto/van. \r\n  - **This proposal would modify the GTFS-OnDemand definition of car/auto to exclude \"van\"**",

More fields might be added if additional use cases are required. \r\n\r\nAn analysis of the possible combinations using option 0 vs option 1 is presented below:\r\n\r\nA corresponds to the fare for the first leg\r\nB corresponds to the fare for the second leg\r\nAB corresponds to the transfer cost\r\n\r\nThe table below demonstrates that while option 1 (using different fields) provides more flexibility and can represent more use cases, these additional use cases are not logical and do not describe practical use cases. Option 0 (enumerations) can represent all the logical combinations from option 1. \r\n\r\n| |incl A |incl AB|incl B|incl max(A,B)|Result|Logical use case?|Representation using current implementation|\r\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n|Combination 1| YES |YES|YES|YES|A+AB+B+MAX(A,B)|No||\r\n|Combination 2| YES |YES|YES|NO|A+AB+B|Yes|enum 1|\r\n|Combination 3| YES|YES|NO|YES|A+AB+MAX(A,B)|No||\r\n|Combination 4 |YES |YES|NO|NO|A+AB|Yes|enum 0|\r\n|Combination 5| YES |NO|YES|YES|A+B+max(A,B)|No||\r\n|Combination 6| YES |NO|YES|NO|A+B|Yes|enum 1 (amount=0)|\r\n|Combination 7 | YES |NO|NO|YES|A+MAX(A,B)|No||\r\n|Combination 8 |YES |NO|NO|NO|A|Yes|enum 0 (amount=0)|\r\n| Combination 9 | NO |YES|YES|YES|AB+B+MAX(A,B)|No||\r\n|Combination 10 | NO|YES|YES|NO|AB+B|Yes*|enum 1 (amount=AB-A)|\r\n|Combination 11 | NO |YES|NO|YES|AB+MAX(A,B)|Yes|enum 2|\r\n|Combination 12 | NO |YES|NO|NO|AB|Yes|enum 3|\r\n|Combination 13 | NO |NO|YES|YES|B+MAX(A,B)|No||\r\n|Combination 14 | NO |NO|YES|NO|B|Yes*|enum 1 (amount=-A)|\r\n|Combination 15 | NO|NO|NO|YES|MAX(A,B)|Yes*|enum 2 (amount=0)|\r\n|Combination 16 | NO|NO|NO|NO|0|No||\r\n\r\n*These combinations are possible, but correspond to unlikely use cases. \r\n\r\n\r\n## MobilityData's recommendations\r\nMobilityData recommends implementing option 0 as it addresses the needs raised in this issue. With option 0, all the possible use cases can be modelled, additionally, the specification remains light, and any use cases which are not covered by the current implementation can be accounted for by extending the enumerations. \r\n\r\n2022-01-31: Issue opened on GitHub\r\n\r\n### Phase 1\r\nFrom 2022-01-31 to 2022-02-11 (10 business days): Conversations on GitHub with the community. \r\n\r\n### Phase 2\r\nFrom 2022-02-14 to 2022-02-18 (5 business days): MobilityData will gather and analyze the feedback provided in phase 1, and will publish a summary by 2022-02-18.\r\n\r\n### Phase 3\r\nIf the community was unable to reach consensus by the end of phase 1, MobilityData will call for three meetings to resolve any outstanding items regarding `fare_transfer_rules.txt`. Feel free to block the below times in your calendars:\r\nMeeting 1: 2022-02-22 11:00 to 12:00 ET\r\nMeeting 2: 2022-02-23 11:00 to 12:00 ET\r\nMeeting 3: 2022-02-24 11:00 to 12:00 ET\r\nPlease reach out to specifications@mobilitydata.org to receive an invite or react to this message to receive a meeting invite. \r\n\r\n### Phase 4\r\nFrom 2022-02-28 to 2022-03-04 (5 business days): MobilityData will gather and analyze the feedback provided in the phase 3, and will publish a summary by 2022-03-04.\r\n\r\n### Phase 5\r\nIf consensus was reached, MobilityData will open the vote on the week of 2022-03-07, otherwise, MobilityData will act as a facilitator to help the community reach consensus through meetings, online conversations, or other appropriate means. The time period for this phase starts on 2022-03-07 and ends on 2022-03-11 (5 business days). MobilityData can be invited to take meetings notes or can be kept in Cc for those exchanges.\r\n\r\n### Phase 6\r\nFrom 2022-03-14 to 2022-03-19 (5 business days): MobilityData will gather and analyze the information shared during phase 5, and will publish a summary by 2022-03-19.\r\n\r\n### Phase 7:\r\nIn all cases, the vote will be opened on the week of 2022-03-28. If the vote does not pass, MobilityData will end the work on these issues and will inform the community. This will not prevent other stakeholders from continuing the effort to drive the adoption of the base implementation of GTFS-Fares.\r\n",

However, an undefined amount field corresponds to amount=0. Without a defined `fare_transfer_type`, the transfer costs cannot be properly conveyed (A, B, A+B, or 0?)\r\n\r\n## Potential options\r\n\r\n- Option 0: Leave as-is\r\n\t- Pros: None\r\n\t- Cons: Leaves the door open for logical errors\r\n- Option 1: Clarify in the pull request and in future best practices documents that for undefined pairs of `fare_leg_group`, a transfer is not possible. Therefore, the second leg corresponds to the beginning of a new sub-journey. This means that the total journey cost is equal to the sum of the costs of the sub-journeys. \r\n- Option 2: Add the following wording in the header for `fare_transfer_rules.txt`\r\n\t- \"Transfers are only possible between fare leg groups defined in `fare_transfer_rules.from_leg_group_id` and `fare_transfer_rules.to_leg_group_id`. A new fare is required to travel between an undefined pair of leg groups.\u201d\r\n- Option 3: Make `fare_transfer_type` a required field \r\n\r\n## MobilityData's recommendations\r\nMobilityData recommends implementing both options 1 and 3 as they address the needs raised in this issue.

This leads to conflicting information on whether the fare is symmetrical or not, see sample data below (are transfers from `area_2` to `area_1` possible or not)\r\n\r\n|leg_group_id|from_area_id|to_area_id|network_id|is_symmetrical|\r\n|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n|group_1|area_1|area_2|bus|0|\r\n|group_1|area_1|area_2|bus|1|\r\n \r\nMore importantly, this affects Primary Keys as the above sample data demonstrates that the other remaining four (or even six, if all fields are utilized) fields cannot describe a unique entry. This would require including `is_symmetrical` in the list of Primary Keys \r\n\r\n## Potential options\r\n\r\n- Option 0: Leave as-is\r\n\t- Pros: Keeps the verbosity of the specification minimal \r\n\t- Cons: Leaves the door open for logical errors, unnecessarily complicates Primary Keys\r\n- Option 1: Extend the definitions of is_symmetrical with the following \r\n\t- `fare_leg_rules.txt`: A record must not be duplicated with any arrangements of the same `from_area_id` and `to_area_id` values with different values for `is_symmetrical`.\r\n\t- `fare_transfer_rules.txt`: A record must not be duplicated with any arrangements of the same `from_fare_leg_id` and `to_fare_leg_id` values with different values for `is_symmetrical`.\r\n\t\t- Pros: Forbids ambiguous data and simplifies Primary Keys\r\n\t\t- Cons: Makes the specification more verbose, might set a precedence for adding more restrictions in the specification \r\n\r\n## MobilityData's recommendations\r\nMobilityData recommends Option 1 as it addresses the needs raised in this issue.  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Timeframes\r\n\r\n2022-01-31: Issue opened on GitHub\r\n\r\n### Phase 1\r\nFrom 2022-01-31 to 2022-02-11 (10 business days): Conversations on GitHub with the community. \r\n\r\n### Phase 2\r\nFrom 2022-02-14 to 2022-02-18 (5 business days): MobilityData will gather and analyze the feedback provided in phase 1, and will publish a summary by 2022-02-18.\r\n\r\n### Phase 3\r\nIf the community is unable to reach consensus by the end of phase 1, MobilityData will call for three meetings to resolve any outstanding items regarding Primary Keys and `fare_leg_rules.is_symmetrical` and `fare_transfer_rules.is_symmetrical`. Feel free to block the below times in your calendars:\r\nMeeting 1: 2022-02-22 13:00 to 14:00 ET\r\nMeeting 2: 2022-02-23 13:00 to 14:00 ET\r\nMeeting 3: 2022-02-24 13:00 to 14:00 ET\r\nPlease reach out to specifications@mobilitydata.org or react/reply to this message to receive a meeting invite. \r\n\r\n### Phase 4\r\nFrom 2022-02-28 to 2022-03-04 (5 business days): MobilityData will gather and analyze the feedback provided in the phase 3, and will publish a summary by 2022-03-04.\r\n\r\n### Phase 5\r\nIf consensus was reached, MobilityData will open the vote on the week of 2022-03-07, otherwise, MobilityData will act as a facilitator to help the community reach consensus through meetings, online conversations, or other appropriate means.

MobilityData is trying this format to resolve open issues with GTFS extensions - if you have any feedback regarding this format, please reach out to specifications@mobilitydata.org \r\n\r\n## The need\r\nThe specification should enable easy lookup for entries, where unique rows can be located with the least computational resources. The modelling of Primary Keys serves to optimize lookups, and does not impact passenger information. \r\n\r\n## The issue\r\nAll fields in `fare_leg_rules.txt` and `fare_transfer_rules.txt` were initially marked as Primary Keys, this is not optimal as it results in high computational load for lookups. A group of stakeholders proposed a smaller subset of these fields to define Primary Keys.\r\n\r\n## Potential options\r\n - Option 0: Leave as-is\r\n\t - Pros: N/A\r\n\t - Cons: Requires higher computational load to find unique entries, leaves room for logical errors in datasets\r\n - Option 1: Reduce the Primary Keys to:\r\n\t - `fare_leg_rules.txt`: `network_id`, `from_area_id`, `to_area_id`\r\n\t - `fare_transfer_rules.txt`: `from_leg_group_id`, `to_leg_group_id`\r\n\t\t - Pros: Optimizes lookups\r\n\t\t - Cons: Restricts potential use cases (see option 2 below)\r\n - Option 2: Reduce the Primary Keys to:\r\n\t - `fare_leg_rules`: `from_area_id`, `to_area_id`, `network_id`, `amount`\r\n\t - `fare_transfer_rules`: `from_leg_group_id`, `to_leg_group_id`, `spanning_limit`, `fare_transfer_type`, `amount`\r\n\t\t - Pros: Balances the number of primary keys to optimize lookups while covering a wider range of use cases (see below for three use cases that cannot be represented using option 1)\r\n\t\t - Cons: Requires more fields than Option 1\r\n\r\nUse case 1: Agencies that accept multiple currencies\r\n \r\n|leg_group_id|from_area_id|to_area_id|network_id|currency|amount|\r\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n|group_1|area_1|area_2|bus|USD|5|\r\n|group_1|area_1|area_2|bus|CAD|7|  \r\n\r\nUse case 2: Travel between the same areas with different networks \r\n\r\n|from_area_id|to_area_id|network_id|\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n|area_1|area_2|local_bus|\r\n|area_1|area_2|comfort_bus|\r\n\r\nUse case 3: Agencies that charge different fees for different transfers between the same leg groups (ex: the first 3 transfers are free but the remaining 2 cost 0.5 CAD)\r\n\r\n|from_leg_group_id|to_leg_group_id|spanning_limit|duration_limit|duration_limit_type|fare_transfer_type|currency|amount|\r\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n|group_1|group_2|3|7200|0|0|CAD|0\r\n|group_1|group_2|5|7200|0|0|CAD|0.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## MobilityData's recommendations\r\nBoth options 1 and 2 address the needs raised in this issue, however, MobilityData recommends option 2 as it allows for the representation of three use cases that would not be possible with option 1.\r\n\r\n## Timeframes\r\n\r\n2022-01-31: Issue opened on GitHub\r\n\r\n### Phase 1\r\nFrom 2022-01-31 to 2022-02-11 (10 business days): Conversations on GitHub with the community. \r\n\r\n### Phase 2\r\nFrom 2022-02-14 to 2022-02-18 (5 business days): MobilityData will gather and analyze the feedback provided in phase 1, and will publish a summary by 2022-02-18.\r\n\r\n### Phase 3\r\nIf the community was unable to reach consensus by the end of phase 1, MobilityData will call for three meetings to resolve any outstanding items regarding Primary Keys and `fare_leg_rules.is_symmetrical` and `fare_transfer_rules.is_symmetrical`.

    "body": "This PR adds new `transfer_type`s for trip to trip transfers to define if a user can do an \"in seat transfer\" when the same vehicle is operating two consecutive trips and the user can stay onboard. In addition, the transfer type can define when in-seat transfers aren't allowed but can link together two different trips operationally. \r\n\r\n### Why are in-seat transfers useful? Why is vehicle operational information on trips useful?\r\n\r\nSome transit systems have in-seat transfers as a core concept on how their system functions. It's also not an edge case or a lightly used feature. It's core to how [Trimet](https://trimet.org/schedules/maxyellowline.htm), [King County Metro](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/metro/schedules-maps/hastop/014.aspx)[^1], [and others](https://www.bctransit.com/west-kootenay/schedules-and-maps/route-overview?route=20) function. With the current definition of block_id, those feeds are not representing their systems correctly. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it's also useful to know how a vehicle continues between trips. The main use case is to help create predictions of vehicle arrival at the start of the trip. Without knowing the link between trips, it's not possible to propagate delay information. This is used by at least Transit and Swiftly for prediction creation, and probably much more I don't know. \r\n\r\n### I thought block_ids represented this information? \r\n\r\nBefore Jan 21, 2017, block_id in GTFS would represent in-seat transfers while ignoring the operational-only functionalities. After https://github.com/google/transit/pull/44, the definition was changed to represent the \"same vehicle\" operational definition and ignored the in-seat transfer feature. Confusion about what functionality `block_id` was present before that change, but that change didn't help. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Google Maps is still using `block_id` under the pre-2017 definition of in-seat transfers (Googlers can correct me if I'm wrong). At Transit, we try to deduce via heuristics if block_id represent an in-seat transfer or not, with varying success. I'm assuming other consumers are doing something similar since in-seat transfers are so important in some markets it can't be ignored. \r\n\r\n### Shouldn't the in-seat transfers be based on block_id? \r\n\r\nThere are multiple problems of the current `block_id` as implemented currently\r\n- Some information is lost and needs to be reconstructed by consumers. The producer knows the order of trips inside a block which is lost when using `block_id`. \r\n- \"Block\" often refers to a driver assignation. However what the spec is asking for is vehicle information, creating confusion.\r\n- Ambiguity around how block_id works across different service requires [lengthy explanations](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/spec/en/reference.md#example-blocks-and-service-day). This interpretation across services is both error prone on the producer side and hard to implement on the consumer side. Some more ambiguity still exists around midnight when the service day changes (should it continue or not?). \r\n\r\n### Why use `transfer_type`? \r\n\r\nThe recent addition of trip to trip transfers in the spec allows us to make the type of transfer explicit. The idea of using `transfer_type` actually comes from @antrim from an old PR https://github.com/google/transit/pull/32. \r\n\r\nIn addition\r\n- It provides in-seat transfer information, absent from block_id.\r\n- It makes a clear distinction between transfers where riders _can_ stay on board and transfers where riders _cannot_ stay on board while not duplicating that information.\r\n- It makes trip continuations explicit without any reconstructing of information.\r\n- It now allows for coupling and uncoupling of vehicles in a continuation\r\n- It allows producers and consumers of block_ids to still use it in parallel.\r\n\r\nA downside of this approach is that it's more data heavy. However, data consumers are already required to recreate this data themselves anyway.\r\n\r\n[^1]: Notice the \"to route\" mention on the right\r\n[^2]: Potential future improvement for the prediction engine use cases could include recovery time between trips. \r\n",

    "body": "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI am currently administering a GTFS feed for a metro (subway) Agency. The underground stations have multiple exits to the surface. To my knowledge, it is possible to instruct GTFS consuming applications to specify the most appropriate exit for their route. I have implemented as follows:\r\n\r\nAll stations are \u201edescribed\u201d by multiple stop_ids, with the following parameters:\r\n\r\n```\r\nExample Stop - general stop with location_type=1, we'll refer to it as \u201eMain ID\u201d\r\nExample Stop Platform 1, location_type=0, platform_code=1, parent_station=Main ID\r\nExample Stop Platform 2, location_type=0, platform_code=2, parent_station=Main ID\r\nExample Stop Exit A, location_type=2, parent_station=Main ID\r\nExample Stop Exit B, location_type=2, parent_station=Main ID\r\nExample Stop Exit C, location_type=2, parent_station=Main ID\r\n```\r\n\r\nTrip stop_times indicate them as stopping in Example Stop Platform 1 and Example Stop Platform 2 respectively. \r\n\r\nUpon testing the feed as constructed above with consuming apps, it doesn't fully do what I intended.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7822580/146691802-b3073b92-4b60-496b-8c91-8f8e14a3bb61.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nWith \u201eExample Stop\u201d being tested as a trip starting and finishing point, **the platforms work correctly but the exits not quite**. Planning results are of the form \u201eEnter Example Stop at Example Stop Exit A (entering and exiting stations is always suggested through exit A, even if exit A is farther away from the starting / finishing point, even though exit B would have been much closer), board vehicle from platform 1/2 (correct)\u201d.\r\n\r\nSo it seems like only one stop exit is always used, regardless of what would be more appropriate for the user's itinerary. Now the exits are only linked to the stops referenced in stop_times by having the same parent_station.\r\n\r\nDo you have any thoughts on what should I do to solve this issue? Do I need to generate the pathways.txt file and link the exits to their corresponding stops...? And if that's the case, what should they link to? Towards each platform (all exits can be accessed from both platforms) or to the main station ID (which has no stops)? From the reference available at https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference#stopstxt it looks like I can only specify station platform and exit hierarchy and it should work without pathways. Answers on the MobilityData Slack seem to point to this opinion too.\r\n\r\nCould anyone give insight on how to properly implement this or point to a feed example which would clarify my unknown details? Thanks!",

Should the current_stop_sequence be updated directly after the bus is departed from the previous stop (what https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/guides/vehicle-positions#vehiclestopstatus IN_TRANSIT_TO  suggests) or should it be updated when the vehicle arrives at the next stop what the .proto file and gtfs.org are suggesting. \r\n",

    "body": "With new fields being added to the spec, we wanted to revisit the concept of backwards compatibility in GTFS. Currently, [CHANGES.md](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/CHANGES.md) reads:\r\n> When adding features to the specification, we want to avoid making changes that will make existing feeds invalid. We don't want to create more work for existing feed publishers until they want to add capabilities to their feeds. Also, whenever possible, we want existing parsers to be able to continue to read the older parts of newer feeds.\r\n\r\nAs implied, there are 2 parties to consider: data producers and data consumers.\r\n\r\nFor data producers, backwards-compatibility means that any changes to the spec do not invalidate or change the meaning of old datasets. That is to say, data producers won't need to change their datasets to make room for a new feature. This is seems to have been respected so far, and is favorable to maintain for reasons mentioned above.\r\n\r\nFor data consumers, backwards-compatibility means that any changes to the spec will only be built \"on top\" of current code. Meaning that if a data consumer choses not to implement a new spec feature, all other historical implementations remain valid with old and new feeds containing the addition (the consumer will simply be ignoring the feature, with no consequence on other rider information).\r\n\r\nThe problem comes in when adding features that are non-backwards compatible for data consumers. \r\n\r\nA recent example of this is the voting-in of #284. With the addition of more specific trip-to-trip and route-to-route transfers, consumers now have to update their code to look for trip-to-trip and route-to-route on top of the existing stop-to-stop transfers. If they don't, data consumers may be misrepresenting the specificity of transfers leading to errors in rider information.\r\n\r\nMore non-backwards compatible changes for data consumers are foreseeable. Otherwise, the development and improvement of GTFS would be severely limited.\r\n\r\nMuch of these issues stem from the fact that GTFS has no versioning (discussed previously in #215). While there is expressed interest from the community to version GTFS, there is also concern from other parties that this will complexify GTFS by encouraging breaking changes for all parties, leading to lower usage because of an additional barrier to entry/comprehension.\r\n\r\nWith the context that backwards compatibility means different things for different parties, I'm wondering if versioning is possible while maintaining that changes should be backwards-compatible for data producers. This would keep GTFS easy to use for data producers, while providing a mechanism for data consumers to track added features that break implementation.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to thoughts on this from all parties. Thanks!",

A group of stakeholders proposed a smaller subset of these fields to define Primary Keys.\r\n\r\n- [x] **is_symmetrical in fare_leg_rules.txt and fare_transfer_rules.txt #305:** Currently, two entries in `fare_leg_rules.txt` and in `fare_transfer_rules.txt` can be identical except for values in the `is_symmetrical` field. This leads to conflicting information on whether the fare is symmetrical or not.\r\n\r\n- [x] **Improvements to fare_transfer_rules.txt #306:** The specification does not define how transfers from one `fare_leg_group` to another `fare_leg_group` if those leg groups are not listed as a pair in `fare_transfer_rules.txt`. Also, incorrect fare information might be displayed since `fare_transfer_type` is forbidden if the amount field is not defined.\r\n\r\n- [x] **Changes to fare_transfer_rules.fare_transfer_type #307:** Some stakeholders mentioned that the wording of the enumerations in `fare_transfer_rules.fare_transfer_type` is not very intuitive. Additionally, the current enumerations in `fare_transfer_rules.fare_transfer_type` may not cover all the industry use cases.\r\n \r\nMobilityData is piloting a new process to drive this proposal and all your feedback is welcomed!\r\n\r\nWe plan to follow these steps: \r\n\r\n- 2022-01-31: MobilityData will first open separate issues to focus the conversations on the outstanding in-scope items\r\n- Week of 2022-01-31: Discussions with the community on GitHub\r\n- Week of 2022-02-14: MobilityData will share a summary of these discussions\r\n- Week of 2022-02-21: If the items are still unresolved, MobilityData will host up to 3 meetings with interested stakeholders to work those issues out and resolve them. Full details on the days and times of the meetings will be posted in each in-scope issue opened\r\n- Week of 2022-02-28: Report back to the community on the outcome of the meetings\r\n- Week of 2022-03-07: If resolved, open the vote\r\n- Week of 2022-03-07: If still not resolved, MobilityData will facilitate another round of community discussions on the open items\r\n- Week of 2022-03-14: Report back to the greater community on the outcome of the discussions\r\n- Week of 2022-03-28: If resolved, open the vote\r\n- Week of 2022-03-28: If still not resolved, MobilityData will shelve these items for the time being and inform the community. This leaves the door open for other stakeholders to pick up the work on adopting the base implementation of GTFS-Fares v2\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n### Original message posted by @scmcca on 2021-10-14:\r\n\r\nHi Everyone,\u2028\u2028 we ([MobilityData](https://mobilitydata.org/)) wanted to draw some attention to the base implementation of [GTFS-Fares v2](http://bit.ly/gtfs-fares). \r\n\r\n\u2028\u2028As discussed in #252, GTFS-Fares v2 is a proposal that models simple and complex fare structures in GTFS where the current files `fare_attributes.txt` and `fare_rules.txt` lack. \u2028\u2028\r\n\u2028\u2028\r\n\u2028\u2028This PR presents the adoptable fields of GTFS-Fares v2, where at least 1 producer and 1 consumer have implementation. As documented [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jpKjz6MbCD2XPhmIP11EDi-P2jMh7x2k-oHS-pLf2vI/edit#gid=890539561), [Interline](https://www.interline.io/blog/mtc-regional-gtfs-feed-additions/#using-fares-and-transfer-discounts), [Maryland DOT](https://www.mta.maryland.gov/developer-resources), and [Cal-ITP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lLSok5YZ3Z7jBuzPGeVMvl3r9PFQvJ0yul6wovJqsGY/edit) (for 50+ agencies) have produced subsets of GTFS-Fares v2, with [Transit app](https://transitapp.com/) consuming.\u2028\u2028\r\n\u2028\u2028\r\n\u2028\u2028Posted as separate commits to ease comprehension, the features in this PR include:\r\n- Fare costs for individual legs of travel\r\n- Fares for routes and networks of routes\r\n- Fares for area location groups\r\n- Detailed transfer rules between legs of travel\r\n\r\nThe complete suite of features in GTFS-Fares v2 include:\r\n- Timeframes\r\n- Distance-based fares\r\n- Fare products (i.e., passes)\r\n- Fare containers (i.e., magnetic cards)\r\n- Rider categories\r\n- Fare capping\r\n- WIP: Fare point-of-sale and payment methods\u2028\r\n\r\nThe [#gtfs-fares](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZbZB9ql_Xl-1uBtmvYmA0fwfm1UX92SyWAdkuMEDfxac5w/viewform) Slack channel has been a great resource and community for debugging, building documentation, and working through problems. I highly recommend anyone interested to join. \r\n\r\nFor other questions/concerns, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to specifications@mobilitydata.org.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to feedback and contribution on this proposal. Thanks!",

One simple example is in a place where the local alphabet is non-latin, and a foreigner tourist will have hard time to read anything.

    "body": "Hi GTFS community! \ud83d\udc4b \r\n\r\nI'm working on a new standard to streamline the exchange of historical transit performance data, such as observed arrival/departure times, key performance indicators (KPIs) like on-time performance, and travel times, between systems and now are seeking broader feedback.\r\n\r\nYou can find the proposal at [bit.ly/gtfs-performance](http://bit.ly/gtfs-performance). Below, I've included an excerpt of the document and some prompts to help frame and guide the discussion.\r\n\r\nCan't wait to hear what folks think! \r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nStatic GTFS enables producers to specify the network configuration and what is expected to happen, however, the sharing of what actually happened is not currently standardized, leading to fragmentation of both the production and analyses of historical transit data.\r\n\r\nExtracting data from existing systems, such as a CAD/AVL (Computer Aided Dispatch/Automatic Vehicle Location), may be cumbersome, require technical knowledge, or simply not available. When data is retrieved from multiple systems, such as a separate Automatic Passenger Counter (APC) system, it may only have a partial picture, such as the boardings and alightings at a particular time from a specific sensor, which, in turn, would need to get correlated with vehicle, stop, and trip level information in order to produce reports such as bus crowding levels during peak hours so schedules can be modified to promote safety for riders.\r\n\r\nTo fill in the gaps that exist, larger agencies with IT teams are often devising one-off solutions to meet their unique needs. However, these are often not shared more broadly, in part because so much is custom to their specific technology that\u2019s been deployed. As a result, smaller agencies that do have technology often have data that they could theoretically leverage to improve service, but are unable to do so because of technical barriers.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, transparent sharing of data is not common practice and while some agencies may share reports (Example from SFMTA, San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency: https://www.sfmta.com/performance-metrics), they are often at aggregate levels which make it hard for transit advocates and academic researchers to leverage, such as to understand opportunities for faster public transportation through dedicated bus lanes or transit signal priority (TSP). One example of an agency making information available at a highly granular level is the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), through their [MBTA-Performance API](https://www.mbta.com/developers/mbta-performance).\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\n\r\n[This proposal](http://bit.ly/gtfs-performance) offers an extension to the static GTFS file, like [GTFS-ride](https://github.com/ODOT-PTS/GTFS-ride/blob/master/spec/en/reference.md), to support the transmission of historical transit performance data and also borrows fields from the proposed [GTFS-ServiceChange V3.1 specification](http://bit.ly/gtfs-service-changes-v3_1) to account for ad-hoc changes to service as operations teams respond and address operational challenges. These additional files specified here will reference files already defined in the GTFS, such as stops.txt through foreign keys like stop_id.\r\n\r\nThe most granular level of data can be made available through stop_observations.txt, which will provide stop-level information such as estimated arrival/departure times and recorded boardings/alightings.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, aggregates of the data can be made available, such as stop-to-stop travel times through travel_dwell_times.txt, and KPIs through performance_stats.txt.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is intended to align with the highly related effort from TCRP G-18 to define a broad set of data standards for historical data. For more details, see [TCRP G-18: Draft Data Structure & Tool Requirements SHARE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nI6mWLeFXDpAEQ_FxJEYHHBR28dmYS1L_tpGjxJQoxE/edit?usp=sharing).  \r\n\r\n## Feedback & Next Steps\r\nWe'd love to hear any reactions and feedback from the broader community in terms of your needs! Feel free to leave your comments directly on [the proposal](http://bit.ly/gtfs-performance).\r\n\r\n### For Data Producers\r\n- If your software produces this type of information, how do your users get this information today? Are there any existing data formats the GTFS community should also be aware of?\r\n- Is this type of specification feasible? If not, what other representations might make sense?\r\n- What other pieces of data might this standard want to support? \r\n- Are there additional interfaces needed between transit hardware and software vendors to exchange a partial view of historical data to facilitate building out a more complete picture?  \r\n\r\n### For Agencies & Data Consumers\r\n- How do you get this type of information today, if at all, from existing systems? What current pain points or problems do you have?\r\n- In what types of applications might this data be leveraged? Is there interest in publishing this information publicly on open data portal?\r\n- Is a ZIP file, like GTFS and GTFS-ride, with this data the right format? If not, what other formats or mechanisms (such as a standardized API) might be more appropriate?\r\n\r\nThanks for your thoughts and looking forward to the discussion! For more information, please see [bit.ly/gtfs-performance](http://bit.ly/gtfs-performance).",

    "body": "As discussed in #273, this PR contains a proposal to update GTFS Schedule to [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) in order to disambiguate interpretations and make the spec easier for producing, consuming, and creating products (i.e., validators) around GTFS. Additionally, these changes aim to be useful when articulating obligations in contract requirements. \r\n\r\nNote that [BCP 14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp14) (containing RFC 2119 and RFC 8174) has not been implemented in this initial proposal. Thus, I have not CAPITALIZED the keywords as seen in [GBFS](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/gbfs.md#terminology). This has the purpose of making the initial proposal easier to review with pre-existing instances of lowercase RFC 2119 keywords, but we can decide if the CAPITALIZATION is useful and if this proposal should be updated to BCP 14, or alternative styling as seen in [IMDF](https://register.apple.com/resources/imdf/) (i.e., only capitalizing \"MUST\"s, \"SHOULD\"s, and \"MAY\"s).\r\n\r\nThe PR contains separate commits for each applicable section of the GTFS Schedule reference to ease review (the changes are mostly light). \r\n\r\n**See all the most up-to-date changes in the \"Files changed\" tab.** Feel free to provide in-line comments and any actionable feedback if any sections have mistakenly altered interpretations or otherwise.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n**Edits**\r\n- 2021-08-03: Round of revisions based on feedback from @isabelle-dr and @aababilov, in commit 3875914.\r\n- 2021-06-22: Round of revisions based on feedback from @abyrd, in commit fba6020.\r\n- 2021-06-15: Minor \"may vs can\" corrections based on feedback, in commit 630bd5d.\r\n- 2021-06-09: Round of revisions based on community feedback, in commit 73bc764 .\r\n- 2021-06-03: Commit fb61255 catches some instances where \"can\" is suitable instead of \"may\". Generally, \"can\" is used to denote optional usage by a data consumer or producer, and \"may\" is used to denote optional behaviour of the specification.",

This is in contradiction to the common case of tap-in tap-out systems where the rider needs to provide proof of payment in either direction of the physical gate, which could be modeled in `pathways.txt` as such. Perhaps I am missing something, so please let me know!\r\n\r\nPlease see my suggestion to allow `pathway_mode=6` to be bidirectional in the \"Files changed\" tab. ",

    "body": "Hi GTFS community,\r\n\r\nAs consulted in #262, articles 7.4-8 of the [Specification Amendment Process](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/CHANGES.md) for both GTFS Schedule and GTFS Realtime are not always followed. They state that:\r\n\r\n> **7.4:** If the advocate continues the work on proposal then a new vote can be called for at any point in time but no later than 30 calendar days after the end of the previous vote.<br>\r\n**7.5:** If a vote was not called within 30 calendar days from the original proposal or 30 calendar days since end of the previous vote, then the proposal is abandoned.<br>\r\n **8:** If the proposal is abandoned, the corresponding pull request is closed.\r\n \r\nIn practice, PRs almost always remain open well after the 30-day allowance or have otherwise been left inactive. This has led to noise in the repository and scatters focus on decision-making and participation. At the same time, it is often useful for the development and discussion of a given proposal to last longer than the prescribed 30-days. \r\n\r\nThis proposal aims to: \r\n1. Bring the rules in alignment with the current practice. \r\n2. Have a changes process that is followed and respected throughout (and not only the pieces that are convenient).\r\n3. Bring focus to relevant discussions.\r\n4. Encode rules for clearing out stale PRs.\r\n5. Establish a pace of decision-making in the community.\r\n\r\nThe proposal accomplishes this by allowing PRs to remain open for as long as relevant with the expectation that the PR will be closed after 30 days of inactivity (i.e., no new commits, no new comments). The advocate may renew the conversation at any time after it has been closed. \r\n\r\nWe can discuss adjusting the amount of time to be shorter or longer (i.e., 60, 90 days).\r\n\r\nPlease see the \"Files changed\" tab for the changes. I have proposed the changes as separate commits for GTFS Schedule and GTFS Realtime to ease the review, though the changes to either file are equivalent. As this is a change that requires alignment in the community, we will use the current Specification Amendment Process to guide the proposal.\r\n\r\nPlease review and leave any actionable feedback! Thanks.",

    "body": "Hi everyone. We ([MobilityData](https://mobilitydata.org/)) want to get some thoughts from the community on updating GTFS to [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).\r\n\r\nIn short, RFC 2119 is a standard of keywords to indicate requirement levels (i.e., \"MUST\", \"SHOULD\"). It is used by similar data standards such as [GBFS](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/gbfs.md) and [IMDF](https://register.apple.com/resources/imdf/) to draw clear distinctions around what is required and what is recommended in the specification. These clear distinctions are not made in GTFS, leaving room for interpretation, ambiguity, and make the spec harder to grasp for both newcomers and experienced stakeholders when it comes to producing, consuming, and creating products (i.e., validators) around GTFS.\r\n\r\nIn terms of updating GTFS documentation to RFC 2119, little change would be needed in the majority of cases. In some cases, parts of the spec may need minor edits to be RFC 2119 friendly, without changing the content (such as replacing \"can\" with the RFC \"MAY\"). The goal is to have a data standard that is legible and clear. \r\n\r\nPending feedback here, we would begin this work with GTFS Schedule, followed by GTFS Realtime. Looking forward to any thoughts on this. Thanks!",

    "body": "### Background\r\nDetours are a major part of a dynamic urban environment. Deviations from the original route path can occur in a wide range of situations, including planned events and traffic incidents.\r\n\r\nToday, in GTFS-RT, in these situations, there is already the ability to mark a stop as `SKIPPED` when a deviated route will no longer visit the stop. Additionally, an `Alert` can be created where the `effect=DETOUR`.\r\n\r\nWhile these can communicate some of the impact of detours, neither of these approaches communicate the new shape of the route to enable passenger applications to display the path and assist in rider navigation.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\nThis proposal builds on a recent addition (#221) to support the specification of trip-level properties in real-time and adds in `shape_id` as a supported field. This can reference an existing shape in the static GTFS from shapes.txt or a new `Shape` specified in real-time via an [encoded polyline](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm)\r\n\r\nBoth the gtfs-realtime.proto file and documentation have been updated.\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a subset of the GTFS-ServiceChanges v3.1 spec:\r\nhttps://bit.ly/gtfs-service-changes-v3_1\r\n\r\nThis proposal builds on prior art from @lionel-nj and @barbeau (see MobilityData#47)",

Sozialhelden e.V., an NGO from Berlin, Germany, have covered a lot of German elevator status information in APIs but it would be much better if you could mark an elevator as broken via GTFS pathways.txt and a GTFS RT `EntitySelector`. This would allow providers to mark a pathway, instead of just stops, as unusable.\r\n\r\nHere are some UX mockups how this could look to an end user:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1376\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/192912/115759849-02627080-a3a1-11eb-8223-181e04ea025e.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1376\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/192912/115759875-0a221500-a3a1-11eb-991a-b2a52e3ae9a2.png\">\r\n\r\nTo me it seems almost all infrastructure is ready for this.\r\n\r\nI could try to provide a feed for the Verkehrsverbund Berlin Brandenburg (VBB) beta `pathways.txt` data set \u2013 there is real-time info for around 600 facilities. Any objections, feedback, or ideas? :)\r\n",

    "body": "No where in the spec is it clear what the rules are for ID fields. The only \"documentation\" is in the validators.\r\n\r\nFor example, it seems reasonable that `trip_id` would only need to be unique within the combination of service and route IDs in the `trips.txt` file (in SQL terms, `PRIMARY KEY (service_id, route_id, trip_id)`). However, validators tell me that `trip_id` is required to be unique within `trips.txt` regardless of the combination of other ID fields (`PRIMARY KEY (trip_id)`), but the other ID fields,  `route_id` and `service_id`, are not expected to be unique. \r\n\r\nRelying on implied rules results in further confusion. For example, the `service_id` ID is the only ID in `calendar_dates.txt`, but is not expected to be unique (`FOREIGN KEY (service_id)`), which you might expect if you assumed that an ID needs to be unique if it's the only ID, or if the ID name is a close match to the file name or file purpose. \r\n\r\nMaybe adapting language from relational databases, e.g. primary ID and foreign ID, would clarify the role of each ID in each file. If there are any examples where there is a multi-column primary key (multiple ID fields used to uniquely identify a row) and that constraint is expected by validators, it should be noted in the file information. \r\n\r\nFor example, the spec for stop_times.txt could look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n### stop_times.txt\r\n\r\nFile: **Required**\r\n\r\nPRIMARY KEY(trip_id, stop_sequence)\r\n\r\n|  Field Name | Type | Required | Description |\r\n|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n|  `trip_id` | foreign ID referencing `trips.trip_id` | **Required** | Identifies a trip.  |\r\n\r\n```",

    "body": "### Background\r\nTo remedy operational challenges, transit providers dynamically change the level of service provided by a vehicle for a given trip. For example, for a vehicle that is running late, a dispatcher may instruct a vehicle to go to \"Drop Off Only\" to regain time when running late or address a gap in service.\r\n\r\nToday, in GTFS-RT, there is only the ability to indicate a stop as entirely [SKIPPED](https://gtfs.org/reference/realtime/v2/#enum-schedulerelationship). However, there is not a way to indicate that a stop is going to be partially served, such as stopping there upon request to let a passenger disembark and not picking up additional passengers in the scenario above.\r\n\r\n### Proposal \r\nThis proposal adds support for a more detailed relationship of a vehicle to a scheduled stop beyond skipping it completely and brings GTFS-realtime into consistency with GTFS-static's [stop_times.txt](http://gtfs.org/reference/static#stop_timestxt). It \u200bbuilds on a recent addition (#219) to support real-time changes using `StopTimeProperties` and adds `pickup_type` and `drop_off_type` as experimental fields. GTFS static already supports specifying `pickup_type` and `drop_off_type` as a part of [stop_times.txt](https://gtfs.org/reference/static/#stop_timestxt). Those existing definitions are leveraged and referenced as a part of this change. \r\n\r\nTo avoid an ambiguous state where the currently supported `SKIPPED` scenario could also be alternatively represented as `drop_off_type=NO_DROP_OFF` and `pickup_type=NO_PICKUP` using `StopTimeProperties`, this proposal experimentally deprecates `SKIPPED` in favor of that more explicit representation. When `StopTimeProperties` are modified in a way that impacts the rider experience, now a new enumeration, `MODIFIED`, will be used instead. \r\n\r\nBoth the gtfs-realtime.proto file and documentation have been updated accordingly. Additionally, like for `DUPLICATED`, a migration guide has been provided to detail a plan for a smooth transition for existing producers and consumers.\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a subset of and based on the GTFS-ServiceChanges v3.1 spec:\r\nhttps://bit.ly/gtfs-service-changes-v3_1\r\n\r\nThis proposal builds on prior art from @lionel-nj and @barbeau (see MobilityData/transit#47)",

    "body": "In scenarios where StopTimeUpdates are specified for events in the past, there may be multiple \"Moment[s] at which the vehicle's real-time progress was measured\" as a part of a TripUpdate when there are StopTimeUpdates for events in the past. This proposal explicitly specifies that the appropriate timestamp to use is \"The most recent moment at which the vehicle's real-time progress was measured to estimate StopTimes in the future.\"\r\n\r\nOne scenario where this ambiguity has created challenges is when a TripUpdates consumer relies on this timestamp to understand how old a particular prediction is for the purposes of better understanding the accuracy of predictions.\r\n\r\nStopTimeUpdates in the past are important for informing passengers about recently departed trips, especially when a vehicle is running early, as described in [the TripUpdates spec](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/trip-updates.md#stop-time-updates\r\n):\r\n\r\n> Producers should not drop a past StopTimeUpdate if it refers to a stop with a scheduled arrival time in the future for the given trip (i.e. the vehicle has passed the stop ahead of schedule), as otherwise it will be concluded that there is no update for this stop.\r\n\r\nAs such, additional language has also been added in-line to make this behavior explicit: \"When StopTimes in the past are provided, arrival/departure times may be earlier than this value.\"",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nWe wanted to raise an issue around Article 7.5 and Article 8 of the [specification amendment process](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/CHANGES.md#specification-amendment-process):\r\n> If a vote was not called within 30 calendar days from the original proposal or 30 calendar days since end of the previous vote, then the proposal is abandoned.\r\n\r\n> If the proposal is abandoned, the corresponding pull request is closed. Note that the advocate may choose to implement the feature as an custom extension instead of part of the official spec.\r\n\r\nIn current practice, PRs often remain open well after 30 days before a vote is called. The majority of open PRs have been so for months, if not years. What should we do about this?\r\n\r\nThere is merit in allowing PRs to be open for longer than 30 days as they get developed and deliberated on by the community. [google/transit](https://github.com/google/transit) is also an ideal venue to do so as it serves as the focal point of conversation and allows to preview how the proposal would actually look and read in the reference, putting it under more scrutiny to reach a final form or to be abandoned. Additionally, implementation by producers and consumers takes time. As proposals can get large or introduce major new features, it's ambitious to get everyone aligned and implemented on a proposal in 30 days or less. To do so on external branches may fragment the conversation.\r\n\r\nI see a few options:\r\n1. Enforce articles 7.5 and 8 as they are currently defined.\r\n2. Extend the pre-vote period by more than 30 days (60, 90, etc). \r\n3. No time limit (removal of articles 7.5 and 8).\r\n4. Define an allowance to renew the default 30-day pre-vote period if it is needed to continue a conversation.\r\n5. Close or renew the PR after 30 calendar days since the last comment.\r\n\r\nOptions 4 and 5 could be leveraged to (i) clear the backlog of open PRs if they are not claimed, (ii) put the responsibility on the advocate to maintain discussions and keep the PR relevant, and (iii) can be called on a rolling basis per the developmental needs of the PR (i.e., instead of defining a strict period that applies for all PRs).\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing some thoughts on this. Thanks!",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nAn issue was raised in the [GTFS Fares v2 extension project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19j-f-wZ5C_kYXmkLBye1g42U-kvfSVgYLkkG5oyBauY/edit?disco=AAAAD2zNizM) around describing currency amounts for fare prices. The proposal currently describes currency amounts using `float` or `non-negative float` field types. General best practices suggest to [never use floats for money](https://husobee.github.io/money/float/2016/09/23/never-use-floats-for-currency.html) due to loss/gain of money during calculations.\r\n\r\nWe ([MobilityData](https://mobilitydata.org/)) see a few options:\r\n- (a) Keep currency amounts as `float`, and leave correct calculations up to consumers (i.e., defining currency amounts in a preferred type, rounding calculations to two decimal places).\r\n-  (b) Describe currency amounts as `integer` increments of their smallest unit (i.e., `125 cents` to describe `1.25 dollars`).\r\n-  (c) Add a `decimal` field type to GTFS.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on describing currency amounts in GTFS? We are interested in hearing different perspectives: producers, consumers, and other stakeholders.\r\n\r\nFor general discussions/needs related to Fares v2, see #252.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nWe ([MobilityData](https://mobilitydata.org/)) are opening this issue in regards to fare information in GTFS. \r\n\r\nCurrently, fares in GTFS are described using [`fare_attributes.txt`](http://gtfs.org/reference/static#fare_attributestxt) and [`fare_rules.txt`](http://gtfs.org/reference/static#fare_rulestxt). We noticed 2 main issues regarding this current specification:\r\n1. It falls short of detailed payment descriptions, discoverability of fares, points of sale, rider eligibility criteria, transfer rules, and travel conditions (e.g., timeframes, distance).\r\n2. It has not been widely produced or consumed by the GTFS community, perhaps in part because this specification does not reach its full potential for describing fare information.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we would like to know your thoughts on describing fares with the current GTFS:\r\n1. Are `fare_attributes.txt` and `fare_rules.txt` enough to describe fares? Do they allow accurate fare representation?\r\n2. What are your needs for fare descriptions that are not handled or are badly handled by the current specification?\r\n3. What is your interest in having a new way to describe fares in GTFS?\r\n\r\nAs you may know, MobilityData has drafted [GTFS-Fares v2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19j-f-wZ5C_kYXmkLBye1g42U-kvfSVgYLkkG5oyBauY/edit#heading=h.mhjuwqk2h5r3) to allow for broader descriptions of simple or complex fare structures. But before going further with this project, we would like the input of the GTFS community to know if we are capturing all needs as much and as accurately as possible.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t hesitate to voice your concerns, needs, or general feedback in this issue! \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n**Edits**\r\n2021-08-18: Issue renamed from \"Fares in GTFS\" to \"GTFS Fares v2\"",

As @tleboulenge alluded to, that's a problem when the AVL source is a transponder-based or track-side signalling based that only reports when a train begins to occupy a section of the track. If a train is unexpectedly held at a danger signal, in the background, delay predictions are still being updated because it's not occupying the next section of track within the timetabled period of time. However, the timestamp isn't being incremented because no new location is provided.\r\n\r\nThis proposal changes it to be:\r\n\r\n>Moment at which the arrival and departure prediction(s), schedule_relationship, etc. in this TripUpdate were generated. This value should only change when the data within this TripUpdate is refreshed. If data is updated but the value remains the same, the timestamp should still be updated to the most recent data generation time. In POSIX time (i.e., the number of seconds since January 1st 1970 00:00:00 UTC).\r\n\r\nThis change will allow consumers to use the timestamp as a hash of the prediction values for each trip, in that they only need to apply the prediction to their internal data model if the timestamp is different from the timestamp of the predictions from the previous feed message.\r\n\r\nI'm curious if any producers or consumers would consider this proposal a breaking change.\r\n\r\nProposal announced on the GTFS-realtime Google Group at https://groups.google.com/g/gtfs-realtime/c/c6ysJtZ4nXk.",

    "body": "This issue surfaced during discussion of the multi-carriage occupancy proposal:\r\nhttps://github.com/google/transit/pull/237#discussion_r470345036\r\n\r\nIn GTFS-realtime feeds using the current [gtfs-realtime.proto](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/proto/gtfs-realtime.proto) file, if the producer doesn't populate `VehiclePosition.occupancy_percentage` and `VehiclePosition.occupancy_status`, then when reading the serialized protocol buffer data consumer software may read these values as `VehiclePosition.occupancy_percentage` = `0` and `VehiclePosition.occupancy_status` = `EMPTY`.\r\n\r\nThis is due to the issue that protobufs don't have a concept of `null`. https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#optional says:\r\n\r\n>When a message is parsed, if it does not contain an optional element, the corresponding field in the parsed object is set to the default value for that field. The default value can be specified as part of the message description...If the default value is not specified for an optional element, a type-specific default value is used instead: ...For numeric types, the default value is zero. For enums, the default value is the first value listed in the enum's type definition.\r\n\r\nThat means right now protobuf-generated consumer code is therefore interpreting `VehiclePosition.occupancy_percentage` as `0` if the producer hasn't populated the field, and `VehiclePosition.occupancy_status` is being interpreted as `EMPTY` if unpopulated.\r\n\r\nTo fix this `VehiclePosition.occupancy_percentage` needs to change from `uint32` to `int32` (which [should be](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#updating) forwards/backwards compatible), with a default of -1 defined, and `VehiclePosition.occupancy_status` needs to use the value `NO_DATA_AVAILABLE` (added in the multi-carriage proposal) as the default. Not defining these defaults in the initial proposals for these fields in `VehiclePosition` was an oversight. \r\n\r\nhttps://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#updating says:\r\n\r\n>int32, uint32, int64, uint64, and bool are all compatible \u2013 this means you can change a field from one of these types to another without breaking forwards- or backwards-compatibility. If a number is parsed from the wire which doesn't fit in the corresponding type, you will get the same effect as if you had cast the number to that type in C++ (e.g. if a 64-bit number is read as an int32, it will be truncated to 32 bits).\r\n\r\nMy main question would be what happens when a -1 value that was serialized by a new int32 producer is read by a legacy consumer still using the uint32 in the .proto? I plan to do some testing to see how this works prior opening a PR to fix this.\r\n\r\nThis issue doesn't exist in the new multi-carriage occupancy fields because defaults have been properly defined for these fields within `CarriageDetails`:\r\nhttps://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/proto/gtfs-realtime.proto#L465",

    "body": "In past discussions ([(1)](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/137#issuecomment-457255246), [(2)](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/245#issuecomment-697412756), [(3)](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/224#issuecomment-626716918)) the question has come up if `Alert`s with the `Effect` of `NO_SERVICE` are purely informational, or if they should impact the itinerary results shown to riders.\r\n\r\nIf alerts are purely informational, then the consumer would still show the canceled trip, route, or stop to the user like normal, but would annotate it with the Alert text explaining that the entity doesn't currently have service. For example, if \"Route 5\" didn't have service, then the consumer would still present the \"Route 5\" trip option to the rider, potentially as the top option, but indicate that it's not operating.\r\n\r\nIf alerts affect the itinerary, then the consumer would optimize the itinerary results shown to riders to account for the entity without service. For example, if \"Route 5\" didn't have service, a consumer may present \"Route 3\" as the top itinerary option to the user with an explanation that \"Route 5\" is not operating and therefore \"Route 3\" is their best choice.\r\n\r\nWe should clarify what the expected behavior is for consumers so that producers can have proper expectations when publishing NO_SERVICE alerts and some consistency across consumers.\r\n\r\n*(Note that I'm focusing on what the end user (rider) is experiencing here, and not on the internal implementation details such as whether or not the routing engine returns \"Route 5\" as the top option and then the results are filtered in the presentation layer so \"Route 3\" is shown as the top option instead, vs. the routing engine directly returning \"Route 3\" as the top option. IMHO those are implementation details that we shouldn't address within the spec)*\r\n\r\nThe GTFS-realtime spec on the [\"Service Alert\"](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/service-alerts.md) page currently says:\r\n\r\n>Service alerts allow you to provide updates whenever there is disruption on the network. Delays and cancellations of individual trips should usually be communicated using Trip updates, or Vehicle Positions, using schedule_relationship in the Trip Descriptor.\r\n\r\nGoogle's documentation on how they interpret Alert Effects is at the bottom of this page:\r\nhttps://support.google.com/transitpartners/answer/6374472?hl=en&ref_topic=6159819\r\n\r\n...as well as in guidelines for \"How to cancel a trip\":\r\nhttps://support.google.com/transitpartners/answer/6325970?hl=en&ref_topic=6159819\r\n\r\n...and in \"Realtime information in routing results\":\r\nhttps://support.google.com/transitpartners/answer/6327328?hl=en&ref_topic=6159819\r\n\r\nThe 1st link says:\r\n\r\n>NO_SERVICE: There\u2019s no service on the line or at certain stops, or a specific trip has been canceled. This will trigger Trip Planner to re-route users around the disruption.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd link says:\r\n\r\n>We support realtime re-routing based on Trip Updates and Service Alerts with NO_SERVICE effect on Google Maps. Service Alerts messages with effect different than NO_SERVICE will only be annotated with realtime information.\r\n>\r\n>Canceled trips which may be relevant to the user, are displayed as crossed out at the bottom of the results list (after up to 4 available connections). If the canceled trip is however not relevant, for example if it is one instance of a very frequently running trip whose cancelation will not affect significantly the user, then it won't be visualized as part of the results list.\r\n\r\nSo Google interprets `NO_SERVICE` alerts as affecting the itinerary.\r\n\r\n@gcamp from Transit App in https://github.com/google/transit/issues/224#issuecomment-626716918 said:\r\n\r\n>In Transit we'll mark those services as no running without hiding them completely. The trip planner will also work around those services so you do get the best trip plan with current service.\r\n\r\nSounds like Transit App interprets them similarly to Google.\r\n\r\n@tleboulenge @anatolip-rt @gcamp Please feel free to clarify any of the above if needed.\r\n\r\nCould other producers and consumers share their interpretation/expectation of Alerts with `NO_SERVICE` effects?\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n(1) - https://github.com/google/transit/pull/137#issuecomment-457255246\r\n(2) - https://github.com/google/transit/issues/245#issuecomment-697412756\r\n(3) - https://github.com/google/transit/issues/224#issuecomment-626716918",

But since there is no schema format for CSV like there is the JSON Schema for JSON and XSD for XML, I've drafted JSON Schema version with a few assumptions listed below (mostly for the CSV to JSON conversion), but some extra work would be needed to automatize the tests and to add more complex validations (like conditionally required values).\r\n\r\nIf they are interest, to move forward we'll have to keep it updated down the road, so we have to do it only if it's gonna be used.\r\n\r\nKeep us posted.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nEditorial choices:\r\n- JSON structure: `{\"agency.txt\": [{}, {}, ...], \"stops.txt\": [{}, {}, ...], ...}`\r\n- Assume type conversion for integers, floats and enum.\r\n- Assume \"empty\" means either no key, value is `null`, or value is empty string `\"\"`\r\n- Assume required is the opposite of empty. \r\n- Rely as much as possible on JSON-Schema formats definition (for uri, email adresses...) but still had to define regex for: phone numbers and currency code.\r\n- JSON schema defined is `gtfs-schema-strict.json`, aka it doesn't allow extra field, we can just flip the `additionalProperties` to `true` to create a loose version.\r\n\r\nNot validated (but could be done with more work):\r\n- \"Conditionally required\" rules\r\n- Language code not validated beyond string validation",

Not the modified trip.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\nDetour to start at 0900. Trip 12345 will run at 1000 and is replaced with new trip 12345-1. An Alert is created. Trip Update feed cancels trip 12345 and replacement trip 12345-1 is added. New trip is added to the service change feed along with the new shape and stops.\r\n\r\nAt 0830 there is a change to the detour to start at 1200. Alert feed is updated to reflect a new start time. Trip update will remove the canceled trip information for Trip 12345 and remove the new trip 12345-1 from the service change feed. Alert is modified to reflect the new start time. The new shape and stops are in the service change feed to support subsequent trips. When the trip starts the trip update feed with show the information for trip 12345.\r\n\r\n**Question**\r\nIs there a situation where the trip 12345-1 should be canceled in the trip update feed to support traceability that the trip was added to the Service Change feed and then removed?\r\n",

    "body": "Hello GTFS community!\r\n\r\nBrody here coming to you from MobilityData with a proposal for direction names in GTFS.\r\n\r\nThis PR is related to issue #228.\r\n## Context\r\nCurrently, the GTFS specification only provides the `trips.trip_headsign` and `stop_times.stop_headsign` field to provide information on the direction of a trip. However, the value in these fields is sometimes superseded by another name like \"eastbound\" or \"inbound\", to indicate the general direction of travel.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nThis proposal would introduce the concept of direction names to GTFS, to allow more general wayfinding instructions to be added to GTFS.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- New `direction_names.txt` file;\r\n- New `trips.direction_name_id` field;\r\n- New `stop_times.direction_name_id` field\r\n\r\n## Producers and consumers\r\nWe are actively working with producers and consumers and should have a producer and consumer in the next few weeks.\r\nIf you are producing or consuming the extensions in this PR, please let us know in the comments.",

Don't hesitate to voice your needs or concerns that can improve this proposal.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n- 2020-12-17: Newest thinking [here](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/240#issuecomment-740756958).

While this works great for most cases, there are circumstances for which relying on in-station signage alone can be ambiguous for navigating complex in-station architecture; a particular concern for visually-impaired accessibility.\r\n\r\nFollowing interest from NaviLens (as a consumer) and TMB Barcelona (as a producer) to make in-station routing more accessible for visually-impaired riders, this PR proposes to add two text fields to [`pathways.txt`](http://gtfs.org/reference/static/#pathwaystxt):\r\n\r\n1. `visually_impaired_instructions` describes TTS readable step-by-step instructions for visually-impaired riders.\r\n2. `reversed_visually_impaired_instructions` functions the same as `visually_impaired_instructions`, but when a pathway is taken in the opposite direction\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the descriptions of 2 fields have been updated in this PR to clarify their use (i.e. no changes have been made to the meaning of these fields):\r\n1. `signposted_as` explicits the directionality (from `from_stop_id` to `to_stop_id`) and removes the ambiguity between providing text directions and appearing exactly like the signage\r\n2. `reverse_signposted_as` minor changes for consistency\r\n\r\nWe ([MobilityData IO](https://mobilitydata.org/)) would love to hear if you or your affiliation are interested in producing or consuming these fields. This would give us an idea for which stakeholders to involve in the early-stages of specification drafting.\r\n\r\nAs always, don't hesitate to voice your needs or concerns on this PR. Thanks!",

    "body": "### **Background**\r\n\r\nGTFS-RT provides a way to surface vehicle crowding data as part of the VehiclePosition message using [`occupancyStatus`](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/reference#enum-occupancystatus). An experimental field [`occupancy_percentage`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/proto/gtfs-realtime.proto#L396) is also available.\r\n\r\nThese fields only provide crowding data at vehicle level. In case a vehicle is composed of several carriages (like a subway or train), there is no way to provide details per car. This proposal offers a simple way to provide multi car crowding data in GTFS-RT. This proposal is made with the help of LIRR (as a producer) and MobilityData. Lyft would be the consumer of this data.\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot of our ongoing designs:\r\n<img width=\"250\" alt=\"ss 2020-08-13 at 4 38 15 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39090838/90252949-65613800-de0e-11ea-8fc5-fa0086ba75ed.png\">\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\nTo handle the case of vehicles that provide crowding data at carriage level, we would like to propose the addition of a new repeated `multi_carriage_details` field in the `VehiclePosition` message. This field would be based on a `CarriageDetails` message containing five fields: `id`, `label`, `occupancy_status`, `occupancy_percentage` and `carriage_sequence`.\r\n\r\n`CarriageDetails.occupancy_status` would follow the values of [`OccupancyStatus`](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/reference#enum-occupancystatus) enum. `CarriageDetails.occupancy_percentage` would follow [the same rules](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/proto/gtfs-realtime.proto#L396) than the ones defined for `occupancy_percentage` field (see Special Cases section below for details about unavailable data).\r\n\r\nThe first occurence of the repeated field would represent the first car of the vehicle, **given the current direction of travel**. The number of occurrences of the `multi_carriage_details` field represents the number of carriages of the vehicle, including the non boardable ones (engines, carriages closed for maintenance, etc...).\r\n\r\nIn a given occurrence of the repeated `multi_carriage_details` field, the `CarriageDetails.occupancy_status` and `CarriageDetails.occupancy_percentage` fields are not mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\n### Special Cases\r\n**Case when vehicle contains carriages that can never be boarded (like an Engine)**\r\nA new value `NOT_BOARDABLE` has been defined in `OccupancyStatus` enum. This data is useful for users to determine where they need to stand on a platform, or that carriage cannot be boarded.\r\n\r\n**Case when data is unavailable for some carriages of the vehicle**\r\nThe structure also needs to accurately handle cases where the data is not available for all the carriages of the vehicle. For `CarriageDetails.occupancy_status`, we propose to use a new `DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE` value in `OccupancyStatus` enum. For `CarriageDetails.occupancy_percentage`, as we are using an `int32`, we propose to use `-1` to determine that data is not available for this specific car.\r\n\r\n_Example for `CarriageDetails.occupancy_status`_: Vehicle is composed of three carriages. Data is available only for first and third carriages. To handle correctly the \"padding\", the repetition of `CarriageDetails.occupancy_status` would be the following: `STANDING_ROOM_ONLY`, `DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE`, `MANY_SEATS_AVAILABLE`.\r\n\r\n_Example for `CarriageDetails.occupancy_percentage`:_ Vehicle is composed of three cars. Data is available only for first and third cars. To handle correctly the \"padding\", the repetition of `CarriageDetails.occupancy_percentage` would be the following: `15`, `-1`, `54`.\r\n\r\n**Case when data is unavailable for the last carriages of the vehicle**\r\nThe repeated `multi_carriage_details` field should contain a value for all the carriages of the current vehicle.\r\n_Example_: A vehicle is composed of 4 carriages. The last two carriages don't have crowding data available, due to faulty sensors.\r\nThe repetition of `CarriageDetails.occupancy_status` would be the following: `STANDING_ROOM_ONLY`, `MANY_SEATS_AVAILABLE`, `DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE`, `DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE`.",

Before making any specification proposal, I would appreciate having your input on:\r\n1. If you would like these data to be officially adopted in the GTFS specification.\r\n2. On how these data should be modeled.\r\n3. On the name you would give to these \"direction names\".\r\n\r\nThe needs are: \r\n- Providing riders with more detailed information on directions, especially for routes with complex trip patterns (e.g: routes with branches). The direction name would be a piece of information complementary to the trip_headsign and/or stop_headsign.\r\n- Being defined per route at the trip level, at the direction level (trips.direction_id), and/or at the stop_time level. The use cases would be:\r\n  - trip and direction levels: defining a direction that is true for all trips going to the same direction at all their stop_times (e.g with the Red Line in Boston: direction \u201cSouthbound\u201d for trips heading either to \u201cAshmont\u201d or to \u201cBraintree\u201d)\r\n  - stop_time level: defining a direction that is true for all trips going to the same direction at that particular stop_time (e.g: direction \u201cInbound\u201d until the first downtown stop is reached, then \u201cOutbound\u201d)\r\n- Being compatible with all king of general directions (e.g: \u201cSouth\u201d, \u201cSouthbound\u201d, \u201cInbound\u201d, \u201cClockwise\u201d, \u201cLoop\u201d, \u201cInt\u00e9rieur\u201d, \u201cSud vers Paris\u201d, \u201cT-Centralen\u201d, \u201cFru\u00e4ngen/Norsborg\u201d).\r\n\r\nThe current implementations are ([Gdoc with more details](https://bit.ly/gtfs-direction-names)):\r\n- 1 new file with 3 to 4 fields: MBTA, MTC (SF Bay Area), Trillium, TriMet\r\n- 2 new fields in already-existing files: Transit\r\n\r\nThank you for all your feedback!",

    "body": "I have a question about the semantics of `frequencies.txt` with `exact_times=1`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFrom my experience with GTFS and my observations of GTFS-based UIs, a lot of tools seem to make the following assumption:\r\n\r\nA single trip (as defined by a unique `trip_id` in the GTFS dataset) is *one* vehicle (or group of vehicles) that I can use *without significant interruptions* (such as waiting for another vehicle or chasing to a different line). Often, a single trip is considered to be a vehicle which *I can travel with for the whole duration of the `trip`*.\r\n\r\nThe `frequencies.txt` documentation seems to undermine that assumption however:\r\n\r\n> `frequencies.txt` represents trips that operate on regular headways (time between trips). This file can be used to represent two different types of service.\r\n> \r\n> - Frequency-based service (`exact_times=0`) in which service does not follow a fixed schedule throughout the day. Instead, operators attempt to strictly maintain predetermined headways for trips.\r\n> - A compressed representation of schedule-based service (`exact_times=1`) that has the exact same headway for trips over specified time period(s). In schedule-based service operators try to strictly adhere to a schedule.\r\n>\r\n> Field Name | Type | Required | Description\r\n> -- | -- | -- | --\r\n> `trip_id` | ID referencing\u00a0`trips.trip_id` | Required | Identifies a trip to which the specified headway of service applies.\r\n\r\nI think this is especially important for routing engines: **Now, they can't assume anymore that every GTFS data point referring to the same `trip_id` is tied to one vehicle allowing continuous travel**. There are >=1 \"runs\" of a vehicle, all under the same `trip_id`, but each of them ends at the last stop specified in `stop_times.txt`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIs my understanding of the semantics correct? If it is, I'd argue that this is quite unintuitive and therefore easy to implement in a wrong way. If I misunderstood how `frequencies.txt` works, let's improve the documentation.",

The need is to be able to incorporate information on detours and bus stop closures into our GTFS-RT feed. I understand that the change has not been approved by this group.\r\n\r\nMy scenario is simple. Close a stop and create an alternate stop on the next block from the exiting stop. Per the specification the original trip must be canceled and a new trip created with the new stop. It is the same sequence number as the original stop.  End result is that every trip that used the closed stop must be canceled and replaced with a new trip using the new stop.\r\n\r\nFor a stop that supports two routes with about 80 trips each/day and the stop will be closed for a week, the feed must publish 1120 new trips plus 1120 canceled trips for the next week. The stop times for the new trips remain unchanged from the original trips. Plus the new trips are trips with new trip_id's.\r\n\r\nOur system does not create new trip numbers for internal or external systems except is a few situations like over load service. This helps to keep systems synchronized since all are using the original schedule trip id without having to have further information about the change. The biggest systems are faring, onboard information signs and stop displays.\r\n\r\nMy questions are:\r\n\r\n1. Is there ever a need to keep the trip_id synchronized with the original trip_id via GTFS-RT?\r\n2. Is there another option for a simple stop change so there would not need to be many cancelations and new trip creations?\r\n3. Recommended updates are 1 to 10 times per hour. Is this a recommendation or what is expected for the number of updates a consumer should expect?\r\n\r\n",

Most transit services will come back, so it may do a disservice to customers if those routes can't be discovered online. How should service suspensions be represented in GTFS and GTFS-realtime? \r\n\r\nPlease comment on proposed options.\r\n\r\n- Option 1: Include routes and stop records, remove trips or cancel trips using calendar_dates.txt.\r\n- Option 2: Include routes and stop records, cancel service using GTFS-realtime ServiceAlerts.\r\n- Option 3: Should we consider a new field in `calendar.txt` that would indicate a suspended service?\r\n\r\nThe goal is to indicate to consuming applications the infrastructure and service still exists even when it's not operating.

We know of 3 producers of this data - see [this pull request](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/212) for details.\r\n* [occupancy_percentage](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-vehicleposition) - A percentage value representing the degree of passenger occupancy of the vehicle. Just adopted as an experimental field ~30 days ago in [this pull request](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/213)\r\n\r\nUnless there is a specific use case to have both fields in the spec, we should try to narrow down to one.\r\n\r\nProducers and consumers - if you were to pick **one** of the two, which would you pick and why?\r\n\r\nFor producers - is one field easier to produce than the other? Would adoption be faster with one field in particular?",

See #212).\r\nOccupancyStatus enum values would reflect safely available seats (**NOT** the maximum seating capacity of the vehicle). The OccupancyStatus enum values used during Covid-19 social distancing would be limited to 3, and refer to the seats available for safe occupancy, not maximum physical capacity (edited):\r\n- MANY_SEATS_AVAILABLE\r\n- FEW_SEATS_AVAILABLE\r\n- FULL (This would indicate the vehicle is at it's designated maximum capacity for social distancing.)\r\n\r\n**Justification:**\r\n- Many stakeholders proposed reducing the number of enum values in issue https://github.com/google/transit/pull/212#issuecomment-611667724.\r\n- Whether a bus has **_many seats available_** or is **_empty_** would have the same consequence to travelers.\r\n- Most APC systems may not be able to determine with precision if a bus is empty or nearly empty. Plus, there are no reports of the _empty_ value being used in GTFS-realtime feeds.\r\n- **_Standing room only_** and **_crushed standing room only_** would not apply during Covid-19.\r\n- No feeds include **_not accepting passengers_**.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

    "body": "### Background\r\n\r\nProducers and consumers have identified the need for a lightweight method to take an existing trip defined in static GTFS, and then in real-time say that its pattern (e.g., the stop_times.txt definition) is running at a new service date and/or time [1].\r\n\r\nThe GTFS-RT spec does not currently define a official way to duplicate trips. The `schedule_relationship` of `ADDED` is a potential candidate to convey this type of information. However, the GTFS-RT spec has not clearly defined what exactly `ADDED` is and how it should be used. As a result, multiple consumers and producers have different interpretations of what an `ADDED` trip is [2][3].\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nThis proposal adds a new trip `schedule_relationship` of `DUPLICATED`, which can be used to duplicate an existing trip from GTFS (CSV) but then run that trip pattern at a new time (`TripProperties.start_time`) and/or service date (`TripProperties.start_date`). The existing field `TripDescriptor.trip_id` is used to identify the trip to be duplicated in GTFS trips.txt (CSV), and `TripProperties.trip_id` defines the new `trip_id` for the new trip.\r\n\r\n~~This proposal also deprecates the existing trip `schedule_relationship` of `ADDED`, which has be used differently by various producers and consumers with varying meaning due to lack of clarify in the current spec [2][3]. `ADDED` is soft-deprecated, which means that if existing producers and consumers want to continue using it for their own purposes it will remain usable in the .proto file.~~ **EDIT** Per discussion below, the deprecation of `ADDED` is being removed from this proposal for future discussion separately.\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a subset of the GTFS-ServiceChanges v3.1 spec:\r\nhttps://bit.ly/gtfs-service-changes-v3_1\r\n\r\nA few producers and at least one consumer currently implement this use case via ADDED, so it should be relatively straightforward to change the implementation to using `DUPLICATED` instead. Therefore, this feature could be adopted prior to the remainder of the ServiceChanges proposal.\r\n\r\nFuture proposals may add other fields defined in GTFS trips.txt to the `TripProperties` message  (e.g., route_id, trip_headsign, trip_short_name, block_id, shape_id) so they can be changed in real-time. See the [ServiceChanges proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oPfQ6Xvui0g3xiy1pNiyu5cWFLhvrTVyvYsMVKGyGWM/edit#bookmark=id.rne8sft785w0) for details.\r\n\r\n**EDIT** July 9th, 2020 - Added a [migration guide](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/221#issuecomment-656365202) for existing consumers and producers publishing duplicated trips using the `ADDED` enumeration so there is a standardized transition to the `DUPLICATED` enumeration.\r\n\r\n**EDIT** July 14th, 2020 - Updated the [migration guide](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/221#issuecomment-658257550) to allow linking trips via 2nd option to accommodate MBTA interpretation of `ADDED`.\r\n\r\nAnnounced on the Google Group at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-realtime/XL96r9g3W-8.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/google/transit/issues/216\r\n[2] https://github.com/google/transit/issues/106\r\n[3] https://github.com/google/transit/issues/113#issuecomment-436384798",

    "body": "### Background\r\nSeveral producers and consumers have expressed the need to reflect platform assignments within stations in real-time. However, the GTFS-RT spec currently does not officially support this use case. The spec is unclear whether changing `stop_id` to a value other than what is defined in GTFS stop_times.txt for a given `stop_sequence` is an error [1].\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nThis proposal adds a new message and field ~~`StopTimeProperties.platform_id`~~ `StopTimeProperties.assigned_stop_id` (within `StopTimeUpdate`) which can be used to specify ~~assignments to platform stop_ids within the same parent station as the stop originally defined in static GTFS~~ changes to the stop within the trip (see **Oct 27, 2020 Update** below).\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a subset of the GTFS-ServiceChanges v3.1 spec:\r\nhttps://bit.ly/gtfs-service-changes-v3_1\r\n\r\nBecause platform assignments are currently implemented by a few producers and at least one consumer by changing the StopTimeUpdate `stop_id` [2], this feature could be adopted prior to the rest of the entire ServiceChanges spec. with minimal changes to existing feeds.\r\n\r\nThis proposal uses the terminology ~~`platform_id`~~ `assigned_stop_id` for a new field, instead of (re)using `stop_id` for several reasons:\r\n1. ~~The only targeted use case for this new field is changing stop_ids within a station - producers cannot put any stop_id in this field and expect consumers to be able to process this change to the trip geometry quickly. If the field is named `stop_id`, producers and consumers may start using the field for other use cases of changing stops within a trip (e.g., detours). Therefore, the field is narrowly named `platform_id` instead of `stop_id` to make the use case very clear, even if the spec documentation isn't read.~~ (see **Oct 27, 2020 Update** below)\r\n1. ServiceChanges defines a more robust solution for detours that can change/add stops within the trip by adding a new `Trip` object with new `StopTime` objects to the real-time feed. However, it takes consumers longer to process these new trips due to necessary pre-processing, and therefore this approach is not suitable for platform assignments that must be processed in the same order-of-magnitude of time as arrival predictions. Therefore, platform assignments should be implemented separately from more complex detours.\r\n1. Re-using the existing StopTimeUpdate `stop_id` field to assign platforms causes issues with feed quality and validation - it's not clear whether the change from the static GTFS stop_id is intentional or an error. Using a new field ~~`platform_id`~~ `assigned_stop_id` makes the intent to assign a platform explicit and unambiguous. (see **Oct 27, 2020 Update** below)\r\n\r\n~~To further clarify the spec, this proposal also adds documentation saying StopTimeUpdate stop_id and stop_sequence pairings must match static GTFS - in other words, it clarifies that these fields are selectors to specify the stop, and cannot be modified in real-time.~~ **EDIT** Per further discussion in this thread, enforcing stop_id/stop_sequence pairing matching GTFS is no longer proposed in this PR - it can be discussed along with the larger set of ServiceChanges v3.1.\r\n\r\nFuture proposals may add other fields defined in GTFS stop_times.txt to the `StopTimeProperties` message  (e.g., pickup_type, drop_off_type, stop_headsign, shape_dist_traveled) so they can be changed in real-time. See the [ServiceChanges proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oPfQ6Xvui0g3xiy1pNiyu5cWFLhvrTVyvYsMVKGyGWM/edit#bookmark=id.m61cxqvifvmg) for more info.\r\n\r\n@paulswartz @skinkie I believe you are both producers of the existing unofficial method of platform assingments. Thoughts on the above? Could you switch to using ~~`StopTimeProperties.platform_id`~~ `StopTimeProperties.assigned_stop_id` instead?\r\n\r\ncc @tleboulenge\r\n\r\nAnnounced on the Google Group at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-realtime/3sTrsi2Sw5U.\r\n\r\n**Oct 27, 2020 Update**\r\n\r\nChanges based on community feedback. See https://github.com/google/transit/pull/219#issuecomment-717524976 for details. Summary:\r\n\r\n* Field name change of `platform_id` -> `assigned_stop_id` - The feature is no longer constrained to just platforms within stations (see next point).\r\n* Use more generic language to define when `assigned_stop_id` can be used (versus requiring changes to be only within a station). This broadens potential uses cases of the field without being as prescriptive. There is intentional use of the word \"should\" vs. \"must\" in some cases to allow for deviation from the platform assignments use case.\r\n* Add that you can assign a stop without providing real-time predictions by using `StopTimeUpdate.schedule_relationship = NO_DATA` (based on @sunny-lirr question [above](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/219#issuecomment-679181070))\r\n* Require that StopTimeUpdate.stop_sequence be used as the selector (based on @skinkie feedback above in moving towards using `stop_sequence` as the selector in https://github.com/google/transit/pull/219#issuecomment-675767164)\r\n* Don't block use of `StopTimeUpdate.stop_id` being populated with other values in case others want to have unofficial GTFS-realtime feeds that changes `stop_id` to represent a different stop (e.g., @skinkie with Bliksem Labs B.V. wants to be able to define detours by populating TripUpdates with the entire stop sequence list, aka \"GTFS-realtime full\"). Therefore, this proposal doesn't block the current use or potential future adoption of a \"GTFS-realtime full\" if the community would desire this.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/google/transit/pull/81, https://github.com/CUTR-at-USF/gtfs-realtime-validator/issues/297\r\n[2] https://groups.google.com/d/msg/gtfs-realtime/BZOfsVeI2Cc/gIUjGbkCBAAJ",

    "body": "Update : new thinking available here https://github.com/google/transit/pull/212#issuecomment-669402378\r\n\r\nOccupancyStatus was added 6 years ago as an experimental field to the GTFS-rt spec. Multiple producers and consumers have adopted the value but the implementation has currently some problems. \r\n\r\nThe enum of `occupancy_status` has 7 values, however we've seen that the range of values is not used in practice. We've seen consumer mostly use 3 values to represent the entire range of occupancy. For example : \r\n- New South Wales buses only use the `MANY_SEATS_AVAILABLE`, `FEW_SEATS_AVAILABLE` and `STANDING_ROOM_ONLY`. \r\n- Some New South Wales trains uses all the values available except `EMPTY` and `NOT_ACCEPTING_PASSENGERS`. However, the agency suggest to never display more than 3 textual values for the consumer facing message. More granularity can be provided with colors. \r\n- MTA NYC has limited availability of the feature in their feed but do use `FEW_SEATS_AVAILABLE`, `STANDING_ROOM_ONLY`, `FULL`. \r\n\r\nFor this reason I would suggest to only give 3 values in the enum. `SEATS_AVAILABLE`, `STANDING_AVAILABLE`, `FULL`. The naming changed slightly to reflect the same 3 values available in SIRI. \r\n\r\n~However, we do lose a lot of granularity of how fine the occupancy value can be provided. To alleviate this problem I would suggest to add a second value `occupancy_percentage` to give a more accurate value of occupancy.~\r\n\r\n~It would be percentage value representing the degree of passenger occupancy of the vehicle. The values are represented as an integer without decimals. 0 means 0% and 100 means 100%. The value 100 should represent the total maximum occupancy the vehicle was designed for, including both seated and standing capacity. It is possible that the value goes over 100 if there are currently more passengers than what the vehicle was designed for.~\r\n\r\n~It was decided to have both values because they fulfill two different purpose. `occupancy_status` is provided to give a understandable value for the user (`STANDING_ROOM_ONLY` is way more understandable for a user than 50% full). `occupancy_percentage` is provided to give more granular data.~\r\n\r\nThe `occupancy_percentage` is now part of a separate PR : https://github.com/google/transit/pull/213",

    "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nCurrently, the GTFS specification does not handle continuous pickup and drop off, i.e when riders can board or alight a vehicle anywhere along the route alignment. Continuous-stop services are mainly operated by transit agencies serving rural areas, where distances for reaching an actual stop by foot are considered as too long, and where population density is too low to add many stops.\r\n\r\nIn the GTFS-ContinuousStops proposal available at http://bit.ly/gtfs-continuous-stops, 2 main examples are given:\r\n- Pickup and drop-off everywhere: The Current (Rockingham, US-VT) applies a continuous-stop policy on many routes. A rider may request to be picked up and dropped off between scheduled stops all along the route, as soon as there is a safe place for the bus to stop. \r\n- Continuous stops on part of the route: Victor Valley Transit (Victorville, US-CA) applies a continuous-stop policy on some sections of route 22. A rider may board and get off the bus in any safe location only when the vehicle is running outside of Victorville\u2019s city limits.\r\n\r\nGTFS-ContinuousStops is an updated version of PR #41. It is also a subset of the broader extension project GTFS-Flex (v2), which has been elaborated with the aim that the GTFS specification could support a variety of on-demand services. GTFS-Flex (v2) is accessible at http://bit.ly/gtfs-flex-v2; all comments are welcome.\r\n\r\n### Pull Request\r\n\r\nThis pull request includes 4 new enum fields:\r\n- `routes.continuous_pickup`\r\n- `routes.continuous_drop_off`\r\n- `stop_times.continuous_pickup`\r\n- `stop_times.continuous_drop_off`\r\n\r\nFor consistency reasons, the 4 enums would be the same as the one of the fields `stop_times.pickup_type` and `stop_times.drop_off_type`. The only difference would be the meaning of an empty field: equal to `1` (either \u201cNo continuous stopping pickup\u201d or \u201cNo continuous stopping drop off\u201d) for reflecting that continuous stop is not a behavior by default. In this way, the regular scheduled pickups and drop offs would remain the behaviors by default.\r\n\r\n`continuous_pickup` and `continuous_drop_off` would be proposed at the route and stop_time levels, because the use cases showed that continuous-stop behaviors are permitted for all trips, either all along the route alignment or on a section of it. We have not found examples where continuous-stop behaviors were permitted all along the route alignment on some trips only, which would have led to suggest the addition of the same fields at the trip level.\r\n\r\nAlso, a modification would be made to the field `trips.shape_id` that would be conditionally required: required only if a continuous-stop behavior is defined. The purpose of this modification is to provide the route alignment on which the continuous-stop behavior is allowed.\r\n\r\n**Open Question:** Is `continuous_pickup=0` needed?\r\nWhile searching for examples, I noticed that most of the transit agencies with continuous-stop services were asking riders to wave at the bus driver for requesting to be picked up. This behavior can be assimilated as `continuous_pickup=3`. I\u2019m having difficulties envisioning a continuous-stop situation where the way to request a stop would be different from \u201cmust phone/contact the agency\u201d or \u201cmust coordinate with driver\u201d, and in this case, `continuous_pickup=0` would not be needed.  However, `continuous_pickup=0` could still be useful when continuous pickup rules are unknown.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t hesitate to provide me with your feedback on this proposal!\r\n",

    "body": "Previous discussions (1) (2) have raised the question of whether more than one TripUpdate can be included in a GTFS-realtime feed for a vehicle in the case where the vehicle is serving more than one trip in the same block. \r\n\r\nThese discussions have concluded that multiple TripUpdates per vehicle are clearly beneficial in this case to avoid prediction \"pop-in\" for riders as the vehicle transitions from one trip to another and also give riders advance notice of delays that impact downstream trips (e.g., when the known delay exceeds planned layover times between trips).\r\n\r\nHowever, this issue currently isn't addressed anywhere in the spec.\r\n\r\nThis proposal adds language to the spec recommending that multiple TripUpdates are included in a GTFS-realtime feed for vehicles running more than one trip in the same block. It also normalizes trip-updates.md and reference.md language related to blocks (future work may combine these files).\r\n\r\n1. GitHub PR proposal - \"Define rules for propagating delays across trips in same block\" - https://github.com/google/transit/pull/110\r\n1. Google Groups post - \"trip is in TripUpdates but not in VehiclePositions feed\" - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-realtime/lVPOmi9A5vQ\r\n\r\nAnnounced on the GTFS-realtime Google Group at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-realtime/69b__hYzKNc.",

    "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nCurrently, the GTFS does not handle extra pickup and drop-off limitations between some predefined groups of stop times. However, such limitations exist in several countries (e.g: CZ, DE, FR, NL, US), where some bus or train agencies are allowed to sell tickets only for intercity trips but not for intra-city trips, even though their trips make several stops within the same city.\r\n\r\nExample of trip which cannot be described using `stop_times.pickup_type` and `stop_times.drop_off_type`:\r\n\r\n- Washington DC: pick up allowed, drop off forbidden.\r\n- New York City Downtown: pickup allowed, drop off allowed.\r\n- New York City Uptown: pickup allowed, drop off allowed if has boarded in DC.\r\n- Boston: pickup forbidden, drop off allowed.\r\n\r\nMobilityData drafted the GTFS-BoardingRestrictions proposal to add this use case to the GTFS specification. This draft was discussed in the [proposal document](http://bit.ly/gtfs-boarding-restrictions) as well as in the issue #117.  Some modifications were brought according to the feedback of several contributors, and a consensus has been reached on the option B.\r\n\r\n### Pull Request\r\n\r\nThis PR is made from option B for practical reasons:\r\n- It allows many travel restrictions to a single stop time (as opposed to option A);\r\n- It does not create duplicated trips (as opposed to option C).\r\n\r\nThis PR suggests the addition of an optional file `travel_restrictions.txt` that contains 3 fields.\r\n\r\nThe initial proposal was mentioning \u201cboarding restrictions\u201d. The term \u201ctravel restrictions\u201d was preferred by several contributors, in order to reflect both boarding and alighting aspects.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t hesitate to provide me with your feedback on the PR!",

    "body": "## Context\r\n\r\nCurrently, the GTFS specification does not provide any vehicle information besides `routes.route_type`, `trips.wheelchair_accessible`, and `trips.bike_allowed`. However, most transit agencies have data on vehicles they operate, which could enhance passenger information provided in GTFS format. \r\n\r\nThe following needs could be addressed with vehicle data:\r\n- Suggesting to somebody in a wheelchair where to board the vehicle. Refining accessibility information per carriage or door is the last key information for generating exhaustive step-free trip plans (`pathways.txt` already provides step-free trip plans through stations only).\r\n- Suggesting to anybody where to board the vehicle according to vehicle features or station components at destination. Looking for optimal vehicle boarding is a common behavior of subway and train riders. Optimal vehicle boarding is sometimes displayed on station posters or screens, so GTFS data should represent the same information.\r\n- Informing (more precisely) about vehicle crowdedness. The GTFS real-time specification supports crowdedness, but the field `OccupancyStatus` in `VehiclePosition` is still experimental, and the scale of crowdedness is relatively subjective.\r\n- Informing about vehicle features and amenities. Wheelchair spots, bike racks, AC, wifi, carriage class, dining availability, and other information may be useful in certain circumstances for making travel decisions.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request \r\n\r\nThis PR is a core version of a broader GTFS-Vehicles extension proposal.\r\nThe goal of the current PR is:\r\n- Describing vehicles and their composition (e.g: a subway train composed of 7 carriages) with `vehicle_categories.txt` and `vehicle_couplings.txt`;\r\n- Assigning one or more vehicles to routes or trips, using `routes.txt`, `trips.txt`, and/or `vehicle_allocations.txt`;\r\n- Providing information on optimal vehicle boarding, within `vehicle_boardings.txt`.\r\n\r\nThis PR suggests the extension or the addition of:\r\n- `routes.txt` (1 new field);\r\n- `trips.txt` (1 new field);\r\n- `vehicle_categories.txt` (new file);\r\n- `vehicle_allocations.txt` (new file);\r\n- `vehicle_couplings.txt` (new file);\r\n- `vehicle_boardings.txt` (new file).\r\n\r\nCompared to GTFS-Vehicles full version (still at the discussion stage), this PR _does not_ include, mainly:\r\n- Vehicle features and amenities in `vehicle_categories.txt`;\r\n- Door information in `vehicle_doors.txt` and `vehicle_boardings.txt`;\r\n- Vehicle allocation and orientation in `stop_times.txt`;\r\n- Crowdedness information in message `OccupancyDescriptor`.\r\n\r\n## Links\r\nGTFS-Vehicles (Core version) - this PR: http://bit.ly/gtfs-vehicles-core\r\nGTFS-Vehicles (Full version): http://bit.ly/gtfs-vehicles",

    "body": "This PR proposes a more fine granular modeling of bike carriage. It addresses #198.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the availability of bike carriage can be specified via trips.bike_allowed.\r\nHowever, many transport agencies (dis)allow bike carriage during specific time windows.\r\nOr there are routes, where bicycles are allowed to (un)board only at specific stops.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support these policies by introducing a new optional field `stop_times.bikes_allowed` with the following options:\r\n\r\n```\r\n`0` or empty - No bike information for this stop. In this case `trip.bikes_allowed` defines, if bikes are allowed.\r\n`1` - Mounting/unmounting with bicycle is allowed.\r\n`2` - No bicycles are allowed beyond this stop. Bicycles on board must unmount at this stop.\r\n`3` - Bicycles are allowed to stay on board, but are not allowed to mount/unmount at this stop.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote however, that this straight forward modeling maps time policies to static stop_times. It's disadvantage is loosing the specific time window semantics, which could be problematic in realtime situations when delays occur. I'm unsure, how transport agencies handle such situations. If they'd require cyclists to adhere strictly to the official time windows, a proper file (e.g. `bike_allowance.txt`) with fields `trip_id`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `bikes_allowed` perhaps would be necessary.\r\nSuch a file additionally could provide notes regarding fare policies when carrying a bike.\r\n\r\nN.B.: I'd like to announce this PR via gtfs-changes, but can't access it. Could anyone grant me access rights?",

(aka, a \"run\", also colloquially \"paddle\") The current GTFS spec does permit an optional \"block_id\" to be specified on a trip, which is used to denote a group of work that a vehicle will accomplish. This pull request amends the spec to allow an optional \"run_id\" to be specified on a trip as well as on an individual stop time to denote the group of work a driver/operator will accomplish.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nSyncromatics has been using a nonstandard representation of runs based directly on Schedule Masters' \"runcut.txt\" file, which uses a cumbersome trip and stop key to identify the starts and ends of runs. This has been very difficult to update manually, which is antithetical to the GTFS spec's \"Feeds should be easy to create and edit\" guiding principle.",

The existing fields `feed_publisher_url` and `agency_name` aren't enough, because many other stakeholders may be implied and they should be given credit.\r\n\r\nGiven the broad variety of such stakeholders (French \"Autorit\u00e9 Organisatrice\", German \"Verbund\", the SF Bay Area MTC which is \"planning, financing and coordinating\", aggregators like Danish Rejseplannen...), the proposal allows to name them freely and to classify them as necessary either as producers, operators, or authorities.\r\n\r\nThe Danish data producer Rejseplanen is already producing the file attributions.txt according to this proposal. Datasets are available [here (new version)](http://www.rejseplanen.info/labs/GTFS_New.zip) or [here (old version)](http://www.rejseplanen.info/labs/GTFS_Old.zip) \u2014 both versions include attributions.txt.\r\n\r\nGoogle is also consuming the attributions.txt file.\r\n\r\n### Pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR is related to the issue [Attributions in GTFS](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/138) and concerns the proposal [GTFS-Attributions (core only)](http://bit.ly/gtfs-attributions-core) according to the current (2019-12-02T18:08:00-05:00) state of the Google Doc.\r\n\r\nThis PR suggests the addition of:\r\n- attributions.txt (new file)\r\n\r\nCompared to [GTFS-Attributions full version]( http://bit.ly/gtfs-attributions), this PR _does not_ include:\r\n- attribution_scopes.txt (new file)\r\n- translations.txt (extended file - still at the proposal step)\r\n",

    "body": "The \"pathways and locations\" pull request #143 introduced several new location_types for stops, generalizing stops into nodes for use in routable graphs of stations. \r\n\r\nWhen talking to @t2gran today about the internal domain model of a GTFS consumer application (OTP) we realized neither of us really understood some new location_types, even after reading the spec. So I believe some definitions and explanations should be revised, especially if they are to be understood by first-time readers.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, location_type 4 \"boarding area\" and location_type 0 \"stop\" have very similar descriptions, and one can only guess at their different roles if one knows to read the descriptions of parent_station field and pathways.txt. Even then it is not entirely clear that location_type 0 is a \"true\" stop referenced in schedules, while 4 is a micro-mapping modeling node akin to type 3.\r\n\r\nThe location_type section should clearly state if only location_type 0 may be referenced by stop_times, and whether all the other location_types instead serve to model movement within stations and logical groupings of platforms into stations, and often only make sense in the presence of a pathways table. It must be apparent to the first time reader that only stops (location_type 0) are truly necessary and universally used, and that the rest of the types are set apart as conceptual generalizations of \"stop\" to \"node\" or \"point\".\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the section on parent_station implies that location_type 4 boarding areas are hierarchically under platforms (i.e. under stops, location_type 0) at the lowest level in a hierarchy. Further explanation is needed. It's not clear (at least on first reading, without piecing together disparate parts of the spec) how a GTFS consumer system would ever determine which boarding area a rider would need to pass through, because the transition into the public transit network happens at the location_type 0 level. Any movement via pathways to a location_type 4 is a movement to a leaf node, and therefore cannot be located along any path through the network.\r\n\r\nI see some text in the platforms.txt section stating: \"A platform that has boarding areas is treated as a parent object, not a point. It may not have pathways assigned. All pathways should be for boarding areas.\" This provides some hints about how pathways are connected, but it's still not explicitly stated how this relates to stop_times. The expressions \"parent object\" and \"not a point\" are not well-defined and it's difficult to know what they imply or require. My understanding is that by following pathways we can reach boarding areas only (never platforms), and that the routing system must then make the transition up the hierarchy from boarding location to platform when relating to schedule data from stop_times. This seems somewhat awkward to me, but I see how it could work. If this is the intended meaning and behavior, it should be explained more fully, and information included in all fields related to this structure.\r\n\r\nFinally, based on recent discussions I think it would be best to avoid the aliasing of platform_type 0 \"stop\" as \"platform\". The spec should say that stops are effectively platforms when they are within a station (as a helpful mental image), but we should not introduce both of these as standard terms in the data model vocabulary - this rapidly leads to confusion by implying that they are distinct types that might have different type codes.\r\n",

Or if people find it confusing to say that the data structure is unordered (if they see files and streams as inherently ordered), then just a statement that the order does not have any meaning.\r\n\r\nAnd my response:\r\n\r\n>I agree that it would be useful to state somewhere at the top that entities aren't assumed to be ordered unless otherwise stated. However, I do think it's useful to call this out specifically for trip updates. The reason for the question here is that stop_time_updates ARE required to be ordered within a trip_update. Because trips have an order in a block in GTFS, it's reasonable to ask if the ordering of stop_time_updates in GTFS-realtime extends beyond the trip_update to the entire block (i.e., multiple trip_updates).\r\n>\r\n>Given the vote for this passed, I'll go ahead and merge and then work on another proposal for this.",

I tracked down how to submit changes to the spec on this repo, only to find that the spec here has already been updated to correctly define `parent_station` for boarding areas.\r\n\r\nReference spec on developers.google.com: https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/\r\nReference spec here on GitHub: https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/spec/en/reference.md\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know who updates developers.google.com, and if we can ask them to do so with the newest version of the spec from this repo? I spent the better part of an hour puzzling over the inconsistency, and I don't want others to go through the same thing.\r\n\r\nThanks so much for all the great work you do!",

For example, if there are trips with `trip_ids` 1, 2, and 3 that all belong to one block, and the vehicle travels trip 1, then trip 2, and then trip 3, do the `trip_update` entities in the feed need to be added in the order of 1, 2, 3?\r\n\r\nCurrently the GTFS-realtime spec is silent on this issue ([it does say](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/trip-updates.md#stop-time-updates) that within a trip, `stop_time_updates` must be provided in stop sequence-order).\r\n\r\n~~This proposal clarifies this by recommending, but not requiring, that TripUpdates should be added in block-order in the feed.~~\r\n\r\n**EDIT** After discussion, this proposal now simply states the current practice - that producers aren't required to add trips to a feed in block-order.\r\n\r\nAnnounced on the GTFS-realtime Google Group at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-realtime/YYJmj91n0TM.",

    "body": "Currently, [TripDescriptor.ScheduleRelationship](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#enum-schedulerelationship-1) has an enum value of `UNSCHEDULED`, which is defined as:\r\n\r\n>A trip that is running with no schedule associated to it - this value is used to identify trips defined in GTFS frequencies.txt with exact_times = 0. It should not be used to describe trips not defined in GTFS frequencies.txt, or trips in GTFS frequencies.txt with exact_times = 1.\r\n\r\nHowever, there currently is no corresponding value for exact_times=0 trips for [StopTimeUpdate.ScheduleRelationship](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#enum-schedulerelationship), as it doesn't have an `UNSCHEDULED` value.\r\n\r\nAs a result, you could have a feed that looks like this, which is incorrect:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nentity {\r\n  id: \"1121\"\r\n  trip_update {\r\n    trip {\r\n      trip_id: \"5\"\r\n      start_time: \"19:29:28\"\r\n      start_date: \"20180910\"\r\n      schedule_relationship: UNSCHEDULED\r\n      route_id: \"C\"\r\n    }\r\n    stop_time_update {\r\n      stop_sequence: 1\r\n      arrival {\r\n        time: 1536609516\r\n      }\r\n      stop_id: \"421\"\r\n      schedule_relationship: SCHEDULED\r\n    }\r\n    stop_time_update {\r\n      stop_sequence: 2\r\n      arrival {\r\n        time: 1536609552\r\n      }\r\n      stop_id: \"425\"\r\n      schedule_relationship: SCHEDULED\r\n    }\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nEven worse, because `SCHEDULED` is the default value if `schedule_relationship` is not populated, the `schedule_relationship: SCHEDULED` is actually implied if we don't provide a separate enum value to represent exact_times=0 trips.\r\n\r\nAs a result, currently it isn't possible to correctly represent `stop_time_updates` for exact_times=0 trips.\r\n\r\nThis proposal adds a StopTimeUpdate.ScheduleRelationship `UNSCHEDULED` value so that exact_times=0 trip `stop_time_updates` can be correctly labeled.\r\n\r\nAnnounced on the GTFS-realtime Google Group at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-realtime/qDVethThcQc.",

    "body": "In the past, it was unclear whether TripDescriptor could reference more than one trip at a time when used within Alert EntitySelector.\r\n\r\nThis change clarifies TripDescriptor as follows:\r\n* TripDescriptor always refers to a single trip instances - it cannot be used to identify sets of trips. If a TripDescriptor doesn't resolve to a single trip instance, it's an error and consumers can drop the data.\r\n* List examples of known cases where additional fields other than trip_id are required to resolve TripDescriptor to a single trip instance\r\n* TripDescriptor.route_id cannot be used within an Alert EntitySelector - use EntitySelector.route_id instead\r\n* ScheduleRelationship field is ignored by consumers if set within an EntitySelector.TripDescriptor\r\n\r\nBasic descriptions for the fields in Alert EntitySelector are also added.\r\n\r\nA big motivator for these clarifications is to make it easier to distinguish data errors - in some cases it hasn't been clear if data was missing or if agencies intended to reference multiple trips.\r\n\r\nAnnounced on the GTFS-realtime Google Group at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-realtime/ZlqUyM9hiV4.\r\n\r\n**EDIT** Following discussion, this proposal also adds EntitySelector.direction_id as an experimental field to avoid losing the ability to reference all trips in one direction for a route.",

Is that different for Google employee and non-Google employee? It should probably be specified in https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/CHANGES.md\r\n\r\nIt makes following this repo harder on Github, because now not all PRs and issues are relevant to specs (which I think most people following this repo are interested in). \r\n\r\nIf this is also a place where scripts should go, what is https://github.com/google/transitfeed role? It also includes scripts in addition to the library itself. \r\n\r\nPing @aababilov",

    "body": "Hi GTFS community!\r\n\r\nAs you know, to open the vote on a proposal, we currently need:\r\n- a proposal\r\n- a producer, producing a GTFS which uses the proposal\r\n- a consumer, consuming GTFSs which uses the proposal \r\n\r\nSome stakeholders complain that they have to implement new feature before having the proposal being voted. I think we should still wait to have producer & consumer to add to the core spec, but maybe we could have another vote, a kind of \"vote on proposal\", which would show that the community agrees on the current version, and that stakeholder can start considering implementations.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on that?

The platform is assigned only at the last minute, when the boarding starts.\r\n\r\nIn GTFS, platforms have `location_type=0` and stations have `location_type=1`. Schedules can only be provided on platforms currently.\r\n\r\n=> How should schedules be provided when the platform is not assigned in advance?\r\n\r\n(Please note that the proposal GTFS-ServiceChanges v3 (discussed in issue #113 and available at [bit.ly/gtfs-service-changes-v3](http://bit.ly/gtfs-service-changes-v3)) offers already a way to update platform in real-time. So this part of the conversation should be discussed in #113. This current issue is meant to be about the **scheduled** representation of unassigned platform, expecting GTFS-TripUpdates to provide the correct information in real-time.)\r\n\r\n### Option 0: Schedule on any platform, then update in real-time with the right platform.\r\n**Pro**: It's likely what most data producers already do.\r\n**Con**: The information is non-accurate, since riders might go to a platform (and maybe even board on a train) which is not the good one.\r\n\r\n### Option 1: Add a \"fake\" platform, and assign trip on it as long as the platform is not assigned.\r\n**Pro**: It works with the current spec.\r\n**Con**: This is a hack, and as soon as an agency will use **GTFS-Pathways**, they will either (i) not link this platform with pathways, leading the trip planner to declare it unaccessible or (ii) link it to everywhere in the station, leading wrong trip planner result.\r\n\r\n### Option 2: Assign stop times on station, until the platform is assigned\r\n**Pro**: It is how riders think about it. The train is scheduled from \"Main Station\", without more indication.\r\n**Con**: Without being strictly speaking non-backward-compatible, it will still require some change on data consumers that expect stop times to always be on platform and not on station.\r\n\r\n=> What do you think? Should I open a PR to allow scheduling on station? Should we think about a more complex representation (describing waiting areas in station? Halls?)\r\n\r\nPing Andrew (@abryd) who asked me to open this issue.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

    "body": "tldr: Google is using an unofficial GTFS extension to describe platform code, documented [here](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/gtfs-extensions#station-platforms). This proposal offers to add it to the official specification.\r\n\r\n### The need\r\nStops in GTFS can represent two things: either isolated bus stops (when `parent_station` is empty), or platform within station (when `parent_station` is defined). When they describe platform within a station, they often have a name within the station, often digits or letters, that cannot be represented in GTFS, but which are need to inform the traveler on which platform the train is. Below are three example of such:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"674\" alt=\"capture d ecran le 2019-03-05 a 15 49 58\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3440724/53836577-58c08b00-3f5e-11e9-981f-fe453359fcfa.png\">\r\n\r\n(Sources: [Berlin](https://www.bahnhof.de/bahnhof-de/bahnhof/Berlin_Ostbahnhof-1029522), [Paris](http://www.garedelyon.fr/guide-gare/plan-orientation/), [Toronto](http://maps-toronto.com/map-of-union-station-toronto))\r\n\r\n### The proposal\r\nThe proposal is exactly what Google is already using, so that the producers of the current Google extension won't have to change their code to produce the official version. It offers to add in `stops.txt` the following field:\r\n\r\n> `platform_code` (Text, Optional) Indicates the platform identifier for a platform stop. This should be just the platform identifier (eg. \"G\" or \"3\"). Words like \"platform\" or \"track\" (or the feed\u2019s language-specific equivalent) should not be included. This allows feed consumers to more easily internationalize and localize the platform identifier into other languages.",

That's the current behaviour in Transit. \r\n\r\n@barbeau would be interested in your feedback, also curious what Google is doing. ",

    "body": "Hi GTFS community!\r\n\r\nAs explained last October in the issue #108, and as discussed in the Google Docs linked in the issue ([bit.ly/gtfs-pathways](http://bit.ly/gtfs-pathways)), we've been working on extending GTFS to describe subway stations. Since the conversations faded out and since the consensus was reached, some agencies started to gather the data this Winter, including SF MTA, NYMTA & MBTA. They haven't put (as of today) those new fields in their production dataset, but we should be close to that for some of them.\r\n\r\nFrom the full proposal, we extracted the mostly used fields, that you can either see in a Google Doc ([bit.ly/gtfs-pathways-core](http://bit.ly/gtfs-pathways-core)) or in this proposal.\r\n\r\nA first dataset has been created for King's Cross. It's publicly available for those who want to see what it looks like, or who want to start implementing: http://bit.ly/gtfs-pathways-tfl-kings-cross (the PR and the Google Doc are slightly different, since I updated the phrasing of the definition form the old version \"The `blabla` field defines a something that\" into the new phrasing: \"Something that\")",

    "body": "Per discussion in https://github.com/google/transit/issues/109, this proposal updates the GTFS-realtime change process to:\r\n1. Add a requirement of a GTFS-realtime producer and consumer prior to the adoption of GTFS-realtime experimental fields officially into the spec via the \"Specification amendment process\".  This mirrors the GTFS producer/consumer requirement.\r\n2. Add a limited time window for GTFS-realtime experimental fields, after which they would be deprecated if not officially adopted.  Deprecated fields can be \"undeprecated\" if voted on via the \"Specification amendment process\".  An example case is the situation in which a consumer and producer can't both implement the new field within the 2 year window, but after the 2 year window expires both consumer and producer are now using the field, and therefore a vote to officially adopt the fields via the \"Specification amendment process\" can now be held.\r\n\r\nAnnounced on the GTFS-realtime Google Group at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-realtime/bFC2rwxxylk.",

    "body": "Hi GTFS community!\r\n\r\nSome data producers told us they'd like to provide attribution of the data, and that the existing fields `feed_publisher_url` and `agency_name` weren't enough, because other stakeholders were implied... and were asking to be given credit.\r\n\r\nGiven the broad variety of such stakeholders (French \"Autorit\u00e9 Organisatrice\", German \"Verbund\", the SF Bay Area MTC which is \"planning, financing and coordinating\", aggregators like Danish Rejseplannen...), we ended up drafting a proposal allowing any kind of attribution (aka free text).\r\n\r\nThe draft is here: [**GTFS-Attributions** bit.ly/gtfs-attributions](http://bit.ly/gtfs-attributions)\r\n\r\nSince this question was closely knitted with the question of translation in GTFS, we also drafted a proposal for translations in GTFS. It is inspired of the Google's one, but stricter and improved.\r\n\r\nThe draft is there: [**GTFS-Translations** bit.ly/gtfs-translations](http://bit.ly/gtfs-translations)\r\n\r\nAs usual, I'm posting it as Issues to gather your impressions, and if we get closer to a consensus I'll move it as proposal.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nLeo",

    "body": "The current alerts specification does not allow feed producers (agencies) to categorize alerts based on their severity. The severity of an alert often determines the channels through which an alert should be published, how an alert is displayed to customers, and the order in which alerts should be displayed (based on severity). Often, agencies use a combination of the alert attributes (such as its effect, duration, etc.) to determine its dissemination channels and display order. The SeverityLevel field encompasses all these attributes into one. Without a field to categorize the severity of the alert, feed consumers must determine severity on the fly and in an ad-hoc manner, which adds latency and reduces consistency in the alerts dissemination process.\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue we propose that a field is added called \u201cSeverityLevel.\u201d The SeverityLevel field would be optional and comprised of enum values. As an example, the set of enum values may be something like one of the sets below. We are not proposing these exact enum values but instead are including them as a starting point to get feedback on what the enum values should be.\r\n\r\n\u201cUNKNOWN_SEVERITY\u201d\r\n\u201cOTHER_SEVERITY\u201d\r\n\u201cINFORMATIONAL\u201d\r\n\u201cADVISORY\u201d\r\n\u201cWARNING\u201d\r\n\u201cCRITICAL\u201d\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n\r\n\u201cUNKNOWN_SEVERITY\u201d\r\n\u201cOTHER_SEVERITY\u201d\r\n\u201cINFORMATIONAL\u201d\r\n\u201cDELAYS_OF_UP_TO_TEN_MINUTES\u201d\r\n\u201cDELAYS_OF_UP_TO_TWENTY_MINUTES\u201d\r\n\u201cDELAYS_OF_UP_TO_THIRTY_MINUTES\u201d\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n\r\n\u201cUNKNOWN_SEVERITY\u201d\r\n\u201cOTHER_SEVERITY\u201d\r\n\u201cLEVEL_1_SEVERITY\u201d\r\n\u201cLEVEL_2_SEVERITY\u201d\r\n\u201cLEVEL_3_SEVERITY\u201d\r\n\u201cLEVEL_4_SEVERITY\u201d\r\n...\r\n\r\nBy incorporating the SeverityLevel field in the specification, feed consumers can predetermine the extent to which an alert is published based on the value of severity, and build it into their alerts management process. For example, an alert of SeverityLevel = \u201cINFORMATIONAL\u201d may be configured so that it is published only to Email/SMS subscribers of the particular service that is impacted, while an alert of SeverityLevel = \u201cCRITICAL\u201d may be configured so that it is published to all available outlets and shown prominently on the agency\u2019s website and by other applications. Ultimately, this change would allow transit customers to receive alerts on a more timely and consistent basis.\r\n",

    "body": "Many feed producers including transit agencies deploy Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems with Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology that allows their customers to dial a number and receive information including service alerts in audio format. This is particularly useful for transit customers who do not have access to smartphones or computers, or who do not have the ability to read text (due to visual impairments or illiteracy). \r\n\r\nThe current specification for Service Alerts provides useful options for disseminating and summarizing alert information in text format via the header_text and description_text fields, and allows producers and consumers of the feed to disseminate this information in specific languages by incorporating the TranslatedString data type. However, this is not compatible with IVR/TTS systems because there is no field to disseminate text that is properly formatted for input into a TTS generator. For example, a feed producer may want to publish text with phonetic spelling if the TTS generator would otherwise mispronounce the word, or a feed producer may want to add spaces between numbers if the intent is for the TTS generator to pronounce each number (for example, \u201cone two three\u201d instead of \u201cone hundred twenty three\u201d).\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue we propose that a field is added called \u201ctts_ivr\u201d that contains a text description of the alert formatted for input into a TTS generator. The tts_ivr field would be optional and comprised of TranslatedString data type.\r\n\r\nIncorporating the tts_ivr field in the specification will enable producers and consumers to better support IVR/TTS systems.\r\n\r\nThis concept can be extended beyond IVR, and can be useful for accessibility in public address systems, virtual assistants and other applications. For example, a parallel field providing TTS text could be added so that consumers can disseminate alert information via public address systems located at transit stops and stations. Such a field could be titled \u201ctts_pa.\u201d Other examples are TTS-compatible fields for the header_text and description_text fields (i.e. tts_header_text, tts_description_text).",

    "body": "The current specification does not offer a straightforward way for feed producers to provide, and feed consumers to monitor the lifecycle of an alert based on information provided in the alerts feed. For example, there is no field related to when an alert was created, last modified, or closed. This means that consumers must monitor every incremental file to infer these values, which may cause errors. This can be especially important for alerts that are continuously modified by the producer to provide timely information related to the developing impacts of an unscheduled service disruption.\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue we propose that three fields are added called \u201ccreated_timestamp\u201d, \u201clast_modified_timestamp\u201d, and \u201cclosed_timestamp.\u201d All three fields would be optional and comprised of uint64 data type containing POSIX time. The created_timestamp field would include the date and time for when the alert was first generated. The last_modified_timestamp field would be populated with the date and time when the alert is updated. The closed_timestamp field would include the date and time when the alert is closed. \r\n\r\nProducers will need to keep alerts that have been closed in their feed for a certain amount of time so that consumers can use the closed_timestamp field in their applications. Currently, feed consumers infer when an alert is active using the active_period start and end time fields. However, both of these fields are conditionally required. If the end time is not provided, consumers can use the closed_timestamp to know when the alert is closed. If the end time is provided, consumers should infer that an alert is no longer active when the closed_timestamp field is found in the feed because a feed producer may close an alert before the active period end time (for example, traffic delays subside earlier than expected). In this case, producers should remove the active time period from the feed.\r\n\r\nIncorporating these three fields in the specification will improve consumer and transit customer confidence in the producer\u2019s alert information, and help producers ensure they are publishing up-to-date alerts within their feed.\r\n",

Previously, the exact allowed GTFS-realtime version format hasn't been explicitly defined in a single location, and as a result producers have published a variety of interpretations (e.g., 1.0, 1).  \r\n\r\nThis proposal strictly defines what the allowed GTFS-realtime version numbers are so that consumers can do exact string matching to determine which GTFS-realtime version the producer is publishing and producers have better guidance for the values they should be using.  \r\n\r\nValid versions are defined as `2.0` and `1.0`. The .proto file [currently lists](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/proto/gtfs-realtime.proto#L54) `2.0` as the version, and [prior to that](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/33c329b0d07e72744de43319f839810a5df0b439/gtfs-realtime/proto/gtfs-realtime.proto#L50) `1.0` was defined. Based on [our analysis](https://github.com/CUTR-at-USF/gtfs-realtime-validator/issues/318#issuecomment-445282302), 37 feeds are using `1.0`, 4 are using `2.0` and 4 agencies are using other values, so this aligns with the majority of values currently in use.\r\n\r\nAnnounced on the GTFS-realtime Google Group at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-realtime/7g8inwuIpKA.",

    "body": "The GTFS-realtime spec doesn't define \"a delay of unspecified duration\", so this patch clarifies how the ScheduleRelationship of `NO_DATA` should be used within StopTimeUpdates to implement this feature.\r\n\r\nAnnounced on the GTFS-realtime Google Group at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-realtime/kATL9Q7Y1gI.\r\n\r\n**EDIT** additional description supplied by @abyrd:\r\n\r\n>This PR concerns an example of delay propagation. In this example, two StopTimeUpdates show a vehicle being late by a specific number of minutes. The third StopTimeUpdate is said to have \"a delay of unspecified duration\", but it's not entirely clear what such a message would look like. \"Unspecified delay\" must mean both the arrival time and departure time are missing in that StopTimeUpdate. The documentation on arrival and departure times says: \"If schedule_relationship is empty or SCHEDULED, either arrival or departure must be provided within a StopTimeUpdate - both fields cannot be empty. arrival and departure may both be empty when schedule_relationship is SKIPPED. If schedule_relationship is NO_DATA, arrival and departure must be empty.\" So, if this third StopTimeUpdate has unspecified delay, the schedule_relationship must be SKIPPED or NO_DATA, so it is indeed clearer to change the example to use a NO_DATA TripUpdate.",

Our motivation is to make GTFS more clear and consistent.\r\n\r\n**Summary:** This PR makes the following editorial and formatting changes to the GTFS specification. Except for one possible exception (discussed below), this pull request merely changes the language of the GTFS reference, but does not change any of its meanings.\r\n\r\n**List of changes:**\r\n* Standardized the choice of certain words\r\n  * passenger/customer --> rider (Except in the case of \u201ccustomer service\u201d)\r\n  * Blank --> empty\r\n  * Feed vs dataset\r\n  * Field vs field value\r\n  * Transit Organization --> transit agency\r\n   * Note: organization is still used for the group that publishes the feed\r\n  * Itinerary --> \"Rider Journey\" [note: modified Dec 13]\r\n* Made editorial changes to enhance clarity and legibility, including removing unnecessary and repetitive language. Major rewrites of:\r\n  * `parent_station`\r\n  * `stop_timezone`\r\n  * `arrival_time` and `departure_time`\r\n  * `Monday`,...,`Sunday`\r\n  * `timepoint`\r\n  * `exact_times`\r\n* Formatting changes\r\n  * Added code ticks to denote fields and other code values\r\n  * Standardized Enum option formatting\r\n  * Added hyperlinks to all .txt files and websites\r\n  * Put field types in alphabetical order.\r\n  * Different type setting for examples\r\n* Defined or redefined the following terms:\r\n  * Dataset\r\n  * Field Value\r\n  * Record\r\n  * ID\r\n  * Added referencing ID\r\n\r\n**Background** discussion is in the original (@MobilityData) draft pull request: https://github.com/MobilityData/transit/pull/8",

    "body": "There has been confusion in the past over the expected behavior of the EntitySelector object within Alerts, especially when multiple fields are provided within an EntitySelector (see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-realtime/jamsDygrcSk).  In particular, the GTFS-realtime .proto documentation indicates that these fields should be joined as an AND and the alert should only be applied to the entity if it matches all the provided fields. However, the GTFS-realtime documentation is somewhat ambiguous and could be interpreted as joining these fields as an OR - in other words, the alert applies to all entities that match any of the provided fields.\r\n\r\nThis proposal clarifies the GTFS-realtime documentation to align with the .proto documentation to clearly indicate that when when multiple fields are provided in an EntitySelector, they should be joined as an AND - in other words, in order for an alert to apply to an entity it must match all of the provided EntitySelector fields.\r\n\r\nAnnounced on the GTFS-realtime group at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-realtime/GfwvTmAOu1I.",

GTFS currently cannot represent such limitation.\r\n\r\nExample of trip which cannot be described using pickup_type & drop_off_type:\r\n- Washington DC: pick up allowed, drop off forbidden.\r\n- New York City Downtown: pickup allowed, drop off allowed.\r\n- New York City Uptown: pickup allowed, drop off allowed **if has boarded in DC**.\r\n- Boston: pickup forbidden, drop off allowed. \r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\nThe proposal is to normalize an existing practice: the `stop_time_limitations.txt` extension defined by Bileto (@jspetrak). Here is the proposal: [bit.ly/gtfs-boarding-restrictions](http://bit.ly/gtfs-boarding-restrictions).\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

Is there some means by which this can be sent as a realtime update? One option we were thinking of is if VehicleStopStatus could have an additional parameter PASSING_THROUGH to indicate the train is in between station A and B but only going to stop next at C. Once it crosses B then VehicleStopStatus becomes IN_TRANSIT_TO station C. Or it there an existing way to do this?",

    "body": "Hi GTFS Community,\r\n\r\nA decision has to be made regarding service changes, and the feedback of everybody is heavily needed.\r\n\r\nCurrently, many things cannot be done in real-time, including:\r\n- Case A: Updating time of scheduled arrival/departure\r\n- Case B: Updating trip_headsign, trip_short_name, wheelchair_accessible or bikes_allowed\r\n- Case C: Adding a new stop, a new shape, a new route or a new transfer.\r\n- Case D: Have unactivated trips in the GTFS, that we trigger when needed.\r\n\r\nWhat we currently have on the table are:\r\n- Existing GTFS-TripUpdates (allowing to provide real-time update for arrival & departure).\r\n- A proposal to extend GTFS-TripUpdates (#111 , including UPDATE_SCHEDULE) by @transitapp, handling case A.\r\n- A proposal to define a new feed, called GTFS-ServiceChanges, using the CSV GTFS structure, handling cases A, B, C & D (bit.ly/gtfs-service-changes).\r\n\r\nSo what do we do?\r\n\r\n### Option 0: Use only the existing formats. Update static GTFS more often.\r\nWill require overhaul of GTFS consumer GTFS pipeline to be able to process GTFS every hour or more.\r\n\r\n### Option 1: We beef up GTFS-TripUpdates to support the cases A, B, C & D (Cc @stefan)\r\nWe already have a proposal for case A (#111 ), we could easily extend the TripUpdate object to handle case B, but no proposal so far to handle case C.\r\n\r\n#### Advantages:\r\n- Small change to existing pipeline for case A & B.\r\n\r\n#### Disadvantages:\r\n- Handling cases C & D forces us to redefine almost every GTFS concepts slightly differently, therefore duplicating the spec.\r\n\r\n### Option 2: We keep GTFS-TripUpdates for real-time update only, and use GTFS-ServiceChanges to change schedule data (aka cases A, B, C & D)\r\nThis is what I had in mind when I drafted GTFS-ServiceChanges, and this is the current state of the GTFS-ServiceChanges proposal.\r\n\r\n#### Advantage:\r\n- It makes a clear distinction between schedule updates and real-time updates\r\n- It keep TripUpdate implementation as they are\r\n- As branding, it pushes agency to adopt this new feed as a new feature for their rider\r\n- It doesn\u2019t increase the size of the TripUpdates feed (but it may be not an issue @stefan @gcamp)\r\n\r\n#### Disadvantage\r\n- Some overlapping for adding feed with GTFS-TripUpdates\r\n- It\u2019s a distinct feed, and force to open a new endpoint, with a new URL\r\n\r\n### Option 3: Middle ground proposed by Transit (Cc @gcamp & @juanborre)\r\n- Extend GTFS-TripUpdate for case A \r\n- Use GTFS-ServiceChanges for cases C & D.\r\n\r\n=> What about case B (trip headsigns, short names\u2026)? Should we extend TripUpdate also for this or not?\r\n\r\n(Link to the GTFS-ServiceChanges proposal: [bit.ly/gtfs-service-changes](http://bit.ly/gtfs-service-changes))",

    "body": "We have seen that `uncertainty` values in TripUpdates are sometime used to convey the information if a prediction is precise enough to be shown as real time in consumer applications. Different producers have different values where `uncertainty` has different meanings. \r\n\r\nThis causes problems because consumers has to have different interpretation for different producers. It would be better to have a clear value for each prediction that defines if a prediction is precise enough to be shown as real time or not. \r\n\r\nThis is a proposition to add `prediction_type` TripUpdates as an _experimental field_. Predictions can either be \r\n\r\n- `REALTIME` (current default)\r\n- `IMPRECISE_REALTIME` where the vehicle is followed in real time but doesn't have enough precision to be shown as real time to the user. The prediction threshold for the switch between `REALTIME` and and `IMPRECISE_REALTIME` should be the same threshold that the producer uses to hide the real time icon in other interfaces like bus displays. \r\n- `UPDATED_SCHEDULE` where a vehicle is not yet followed in real time but some changes to the schedule was done after the latest GTFS export, very likely due to changes from the control center. \r\n\r\nI would also be curious to know if anybody uses the `uncertainty` value in GTFS-rt without having some magic threshold value. If that's not the case and usage of `prediction_type` is accepted and successful, I would propose to deprecate `uncertainty`\r\n\r\nNote : I might be unresponsive in the next few weeks. @juanborre has my full confidence and can respond in my stead and represent Transit.

    "body": "The GTFS-realtime spec [currently defines](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/trip-updates.md#stop-time-updates) how [StopTimeUpdates](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#StopTimeUpdate) (i.e., delays) should be propagated between stops in the same trip.\r\n\r\nHowever, GTFS-rt has remained silent on whether propagation should occur between two trips within the same block.\r\n\r\nThis proposal defines rules for propagating delays (late, on time, and early) across trips in same block.  It also gives names to all the propagation examples to make it easier to follow the logic in each example.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this proposal is to avoid hiding delays from riders, which can inadvertently happen if propagation across trips in the same block is not implemented.  For example, if Trips A and B are in the same block, and there is a large delay for Trip A, the rider waiting at the first stop of Trip B should see this info in their mobile app before the vehicle completes Trip A.\r\n\r\nI've drafted a [Google Drawing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bLV8QaQkGARX1g1ThdQr9mf7oOCGs3db2VH9TsZ-tgw/edit) to help explain this issue: \r\n\r\n![propagating delays across trips in same block 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/928045/47940181-40613680-dec0-11e8-9e85-2386a946d214.png)\r\n\r\nThe proposed rules in this pull request are modeled on the behavior currently implemented in [OneBusAway](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules), which has been deployed across a number of cities including New York, Puget Sound (Seattle), San Diego, Tampa, York Region (CA), and Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nNote that these propagation rules only apply in the absence of explicit StopTimeUpdates for Trip B - the producer can always specify the exact prediction to use for any stop by providing a TripUpdate with a StopTimeUpdate referencing that `stop_sequence`.\r\n\r\nPlease provide feedback!  I'd especially like feedback on the currently proposed rule for vehicles running *early*.  The proposed rule is based on [OneBusAway's behavior](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules/blob/master/onebusaway-transit-data-federation/src/main/java/org/onebusaway/transit_data_federation/impl/ArrivalAndDepartureServiceImpl.java#L899), which is:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n  private int propagateScheduleDeviationForwardWithSlack(int scheduleDeviation, int slack) {\r\n    /**\r\n     * If the vehicle is running early and there is slack built into the\r\n     * schedule, we guess that the vehicle will take that opportunity to pause\r\n     * and let the schedule catch back up. If there is no slack, assume we'll\r\n     * continue to run early.\r\n     */\r\n    if (scheduleDeviation < 0) {\r\n      if (slack > 0)\r\n        return 0;\r\n      return scheduleDeviation;\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThis handles the situation when an agency arbitrarily splits a trip into two (e.g., to change headsigns) but there isn't a layover in the schedule, and therefore the bus doesn't hold and continues to run early. If there is a planned break in the schedule, the driver is more likely to hold and wait to depart until the scheduled departure time.\r\n\r\nAn alternate rule is that vehicles running early never get propagated across trips, but this design risks dropping real-time info in the middle of a passenger-perceived trip when the agency arbitrarily splits a trip in their GTFS.  And, riders would rather know about an early vehicle than miss this information, and as a result miss their bus.  Therefore, IMHO it seems better to err on the side of propagating early vehicle info rather than dropping it.\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\n* Delay propagation across trips in the same block (specifically on time and late) has been discussed and tentatively agreed upon as an upcoming feature in OpenTripPlanner (see [this thread](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/2295#issuecomment-420320336)).\r\n\r\nAnnounced on GTFS-realtime Google Group at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-realtime/D5taM5vhEJQ.",

It was a suggestion to put a limited time window on experimental fields, and after than window expires they would be adopted (or potentially discarded).  For example, `OccupancyStatus` has been experimental [since 2015](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/gtfs-realtime/_HtNTGp5LxM/23vN1VIHKfkJ).\r\n\r\nSecond comment at https://github.com/google/transit/pull/105#pullrequestreview-160776233:\r\n\r\n>Should there be a definition of consensus? The amendment process is way more formal but it seems to me that if an experimental fields is approved, it becomes hard to change after the fact due to protobuf backward compatibility issues. My proposition would be same process as the spec amendment process but with a \"strong majority vote (80%)\" instead of unanimous.\r\n\r\n@gcamp any further thoughts or proposals on the above?",

    "body": "Hi GTFS community!\r\n\r\nMost of you already know it, but we are working on a set of GTFS extensions allowing to make trips for people in wheelchairs, taking in account elevator downtimes, entrance closures, full buses and more. By describing stations and vehicles, we also get some often-requested data, like occupancy, AC...\r\n\r\nAfter a few months of work, we have two complementary sets of extension. The logic behind slicing the extensions is to allow each agency to use only the portion which is useful for it. E.g. if an agency just want to say which buses have AC or how full are the buses, they won't have to even read the extensions about giving train composition or boarding areas in train stations.\r\n\r\n## GTFS-Pathways extensions (bit.ly/gtfs-pathways)\r\n- **GTFS-Stations** (already added to the specification) defines stations & entrances (It contains the concepts of \u201cstation\u201d and \u201centrance\u201d defined using the fields location_type and parent_station in the stops.txt file. For more information, see the official specification).\r\n- **GTFS-Pathways & GTFS-Levels** describes the inside of the station schematically _(i.e. as a graph)_, between its entrances/exits and its platforms, to route riders using trip planning software _(e.g. routing somebody in wheelchair with a step-free journey from entrance to platform, or somebody with a stroller with journey with as step as possible)_.\r\n- **GTFS-PathwayClosures** describes the evolution of the station thru time _(e.g. which pathway is being closed at which time for construction, or what are the opening schedule of an entrance linked to a mall)_.\r\n- **GTFS-PathwayUpdates** describes the real-time evolution of the station _(e.g. an elevator is down, if entrances are closed because of a demonstration or event)_.\r\n\r\n## GTFS-Vehicles extensions (bit.ly/gtfs-vehicles)\r\n- **GTFS-Vehicles** describes the vehicles themselves _(e.g. Does the vehicle have A/C? Is there a ramp for riders in wheelchair? Is the bus full?)_. This extension is the core of the proposal and is required for every other extension.\r\n- **GTFS-VehicleCouplings** describes the coupling of vehicles into composed vehicles like trains _(e.g. Which carriage is the restaurant carriage? Which one is First Class? In which one can I go with a wheelchair?)_.\r\n- **GTFS-VehicleBoardings** describes where the vehicle stops on a platform _(e.g. Where should I wait on the platform? Combined with VehicleCouplings, this tells where will stop my carriage, or in which carriage I should to alight in front of the exit)_.\r\n- **GTFS-VehicleDoors** describes the properties of each door of a vehicle _(e.g. Can we board or alight at this door? Is this door wheelchair accessible?)_.\r\n\r\nI'm planning to keep on working on Google Docs for now instead of opening a Pull Request, because I think that the interface is more user friendly. Therefore you can provide feedbacks on the Google Doc directly.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

    "body": "Hi GTFS community!\r\n\r\nWho (among both GTFS producers and consumers) would be interested into having a \"Lite\" GTFS-TripUpdate format, which would allow to call for the ETA for only one stop and one stop route.\r\n\r\nIt would be calling something like `http://example.com/tripupdate.pb?route_id=ri1&stop_id=si1`, and would contain only the StopTimeUpdate applying for this stop and route?\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n- For GTFS Producers: Currently providing GTFS-TU is a huge (& expensive) change for agency. They can do it only when there is a big RFP going out, and they cannot just add a converter at the output of their existing tools, since GTFS-TU requires the state of the whole system. Allowing a Lite GTFS-TU as described above would strive the adoption of the GTFS language in the real-time world.\r\n- For GTFS Consumers: It would allow them to parse fewer different formats, and to push agencies to provide a standard and open source format.\r\n- For the open source community: this allows to make converters from other format to Lite GTFS-TU (those formats could be standards like SIRI, or proprietary formats outputted by real-time providers)\r\n\r\nDownsides?\r\n- On the short term it would be a win, since we would have more GTFS-TU.\r\n- On the long term it would be a win, because it would increase the momentum around GTFS-TU.\r\n- On the mid-term though, it might be a small loose, because some agency could postpone the adoption of full GTFS-TU because they have a middle ground.\r\n\r\nThoughts? Especially big real-time consumers (@anatolip-rt, @gcamp, @slai, @TeXitoi, @Tristramg).",

    "body": "Currently, [TripDescriptor.ScheduleRelationship](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#enum-schedulerelationship-1) has an enum value of `UNSCHEDULED`, which is defined as:\r\n\r\n>A trip that is running with no schedule associated to it - this value is used to identify trips defined in GTFS frequencies.txt with exact_times = 0. It should not be used to describe trips not defined in GTFS frequencies.txt, or trips in GTFS frequencies.txt with exact_times = 1.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's not clear what cooresponding enum value should be used for exact_times=0 trips for [StopTimeUpdate.ScheduleRelationship](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#enum-schedulerelationship), as it doesn't have an `UNSCHEDULED` value.\r\n\r\nAs a result, you could potentially have a feed that looks like this, which is not clearly labeled as incorrect in the current spec:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nentity {\r\n  id: \"1121\"\r\n  trip_update {\r\n    trip {\r\n      trip_id: \"5\"\r\n      start_time: \"19:29:28\"\r\n      start_date: \"20180910\"\r\n      schedule_relationship: UNSCHEDULED\r\n      route_id: \"C\"\r\n    }\r\n    stop_time_update {\r\n      stop_sequence: 1\r\n      arrival {\r\n        time: 1536609516\r\n      }\r\n      stop_id: \"421\"\r\n      schedule_relationship: SCHEDULED\r\n    }\r\n    stop_time_update {\r\n      stop_sequence: 2\r\n      arrival {\r\n        time: 1536609552\r\n      }\r\n      stop_id: \"425\"\r\n      schedule_relationship: SCHEDULED\r\n    }\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nFurthermore, because `SCHEDULED` is the default value if `schedule_relationship` is left empty, we need a separate enum value to represent exact_times=0 trips.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I believe an `UNSCHEDULED` enum value should be added to StopTimeUpdate.ScheduleRelationship to fix this, with a definition of:\r\n\r\n>The vehicle is proceeding in accordance with the order of stops defined in GTFS stop_times.txt for a trip with frequencies.txt exact_times = 0 or empty. It should not be used to describe a stop on a trip not defined in GTFS frequencies.txt, or for a stop on a trip in GTFS frequencies.txt with exact_times = 1.",

For an example, see the `OccupancyStatus` field that is still experimental:\r\nhttps://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#enum-occupancystatus\r\n\r\nThe `OccupancyStatus` description says:\r\n\r\n>Caution: this field is still experimental, and subject to change. It may be formally adopted in the future.\r\n\r\nAt some point after the field is considered useful and there are real consumers and producers using it, then it's no longer labeled as experimental (an aside - to my knowledge we haven't yet had a field exit experimental status under this approach).  If not, we set aside the .proto field value (it can't be re-used) and remove the field from the spec.\r\n\r\nWe should update the CHANGES docs to reflect the current process of using experimental fields instead of extensions for new features in GTFS-realtime.\r\n\r\nNote that extensions will still exist as a method for agencies to publish fields that aren't considered useful for broader adoption.",

    "body": "Hi GTFS community,\r\n\r\nThis pull request is the result of the short discussion we had on [Issue 95](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/95). No need to read the whole issue discussion, here is the sum up:\r\n\r\n#### Current Issue\r\nCurrent specification gives two distinct definitions for the two language fields:\r\n- `agency_lang` allows only two-letter language codes, using [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) (e.g. \"en\" for English,  \"es\" for Spanish or \"de\" for German);\r\n- `feed_lang` allows the two letter-language codes, but also more complex [language tags](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/), using [BCP 47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) (e.g. \"en\" for English, but also \"en-US\" for American English or \"es-419\" for Spanish used in Latin America).\r\n\r\nThis implies that the high-level definition of the language (with `feed_lang`) can be specific more specific than the low-level one (with `agency_lang`), which is the opposite of what could be expected.\r\n\r\nThis distinction:\r\n- forces producers to be less specific in the `agency_lang` than in the `feed_lang`, or discourage them to be specific in the `feed_lang`,\r\n- forces consumers to handle two different field formats for validation, without knowing how they should handle a `feed_lang` more specific than an `agency_lang` one (e.g. \"en-US\" as `feed_lang` but \"en\" as `agency_lang`). \r\n\r\n#### Proposal: Unify the two definitions by allowing both fields to use language tags.\r\n- This will reduce the complexity of the specification without reducing it's precision.\r\n- This keeps all old datasets valid, since the two-letter language codes are included in BCP 47.\r\n- This will only require producers to simplify their code, by allowing `agency_lang` to be like `feed_lang`.\r\n- The only non-backward compatibility part of this proposal is that `agency_lang` was loose on the capitalization (language code should always be lower case according to ISO 639-1, aka \"en\", but `agency_lang` was oddly also allowing upper case, aka \"EN\"). I suggest we do not officialy handle this case in the spec anymore. GTFS consumers will still have to allow \"EN\" in short term anyway, and it's a good think IMHO to suggest to agency to follow the ISO/BCP standard in the future.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

    "body": "#### Current Issue\r\nCurrent specification gives two distinct definitions for the two language fields:\r\n- `agency_lang` allows only two-letter language codes, using [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) (e.g. \"en\" for English,  \"es\" for Spanish or \"de\" for German);\r\n- `feed_lang` allows the two letter-language codes, but also more complex [language tags](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/), using [BCP 47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) (e.g. \"en\" for English, but also \"en-US\" for American English or \"es-419\" for Spanish used in Latin America).\r\n\r\nThis implies that the high-level definition of the language (with `feed_lang`) can be specific more specific than the low-level one (with `agency_lang`), which is the opposite of what could be expected.\r\n\r\nThis distinction:\r\n- forces producers to be less specific in the `agency_lang` than in the `feed_lang`, or discourage them to be specific in the `feed_lang`,\r\n- forces consumers to handle two different field formats for validation, without knowing how they should handle a `feed_lang` more specific than an `agency_lang` one (e.g. \"en-US\" as `feed_lang` but \"en\" as `agency_lang`). \r\n\r\n#### Options\r\n##### Option 1: Unify the two definitions by allowing both fields to use language tags.\r\n- This will reduce the complexity of the specification without reducing it's precision.\r\n- This keeps all old datasets valid, since the two-letter language codes is are included in BCP 47.\r\n- This will only require producers to simplify their code, by allowing `agency_lang` to be like `feed_lang`.\r\n\r\n##### Option 2: Deprecated the `agency_lang` field once-for-all.\r\n- This was the original intention when the field `feed_lang` has been added (see [Joe Hughes 2010 message on the subject](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/gtfs-changes/muxms00iBos/TrCb9YYteCMJ))\r\n- This would reduce even more the complexity of the specification.\r\n- Both fields are optional so we wouldn't be loosing required information.\r\n- BUT, this wouldn't allow anymore to specify distinct languages for distinct agencies in the dataset. It it used? \r\n  - Official dataset for Switzerland (which has four official languages) arbitrarily set the `feed_lang` as \"DE\" and then lists all agencies `agency_lang` at \"DE\" aka speaking German (see [GTFS](https://opentransportdata.swiss/de/dataset/timetable-2018-gtfs/resource/432eaef2-8e65-4eed-b8c9-8ffe55c60581)).\r\n  - Official dataset for trains in Belgium (which has three official languages) set arbitrary the `feed_lang` as \"NL\" and do not provide language for agencies, since there is only one agency, the NMBS/SNCB (see [GTFS](https://transitfeeds.com/p/societe-nationale-des-chemins-de-fer-belges/528))\r\n  - => Are you aware of cases where that feature is used?\r\n\r\n(I personally leans sightly toward option 2, but I would also be fine with option 1, rather than keeping the current inconsistency)\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\nThis difference exists for historical reason. The two fields have not been added at the same time.\r\n\r\n- About option 1, extending the definition of the `agency_lang` field has already been proposed in 2009: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-changes/mZHnGsHLPyw\r\n- About option 2, discussing the usefulness of `agency_lang` when we have a `feed_lang` has already been done twice:\r\n  - in 2010 by Joe Hughes: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/gtfs-changes/muxms00iBos/TrCb9YYteCMJ\r\n  - and 2011 by Brian Ferris: and https://groups.google.com/d/msg/gtfs-changes/Sh0e4o9o2Gw/z91_sSyHXFsJ",

These numbers are used to identify your fields in the message binary format, and should not be changed once your message type is in use.\r\n\r\nWe should add this text to the GTFS-realtime extensions section to make sure that producers don't break their custom extensions (even if the field is just defined for a proposal) when they are in use.\r\n\r\nFor example, if Agency X uses field number `1` for an extension for a GTFS-rt proposal, then it can never use `1` again in the future for another field, even if the proposal was accepted and the field `1` is no longer in use.\r\n\r\nWe should also add a link to the \"Assigning Field Numbers\" section in the GTFS-realtime extensions section too:\r\nhttps://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#assigning-field-numbers\r\n\r\n...as there are other guidelines there for selecting field number values.",

    "body": "#### Current Issue\r\nAs data consumer, knowing which producer has real-time and tracking which producer adds real-time is time consuming and requires manual searches. Also, keeping track of the changes of the different real-time URLs (Trip Updates, Vehicle Positions and Service Alerts URLs) is also time consuming and could lead to silent bugs or time-downs.\r\n\r\n_[Updated on 2018-08-09 to add discovery]\r\n[Updated on 2018-08-15 14:55 UTC to add the example]\r\n[Updated on 2018-08-27 12:37 UTC to add the fields `authentication_type `, `authentication_info_url` & `api_key_parameter_name `]_\r\n\r\n#### Proposal\r\nWe can add those real-time URLs in an extra file of the GTFS.\r\n\r\nThis proposal adds a new file called `linked_datasets.txt`, containing the fields:\r\n- `url` (String, required): A full URL, linking to the other dataset;\r\n- `trip_updates` (Boolean, required): Whether the dataset at this URL may contain [a `TripUpdate` entity](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-tripupdate).\r\n- `vehicle_positions` (Boolean, required): Whether the dataset at this URL may contain [a `VehiclePosition` entity](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-vehicleposition).\r\n- `service_alerts` (Boolean, required): Whether the dataset at this URL may contain [an `Alert` entity](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-alert).\r\n- `authentication_type` (Integer, required): Defines the type of authentication required to access the URL. The allowed values are:\r\n  - 0 or empty: No authentication required.\r\n  - 1: Ad-hoc authentication required, please check on agency website for more.\r\n  - 2: The authentication requires an API key, which should be passed as value of the parameter `api_key_parameter_name` in the URL.\r\n- `authentication_info_url` (String, optional): If an authentication is required, this field contains an URL to a human readable page describing how the authentication should be done and how potential credentials can be created. Required if `authentication_type` is 1 or greater.\r\n- `api_key_parameter_name` (String, optional): Name of the parameter to pass in the URL to provide the API key. Required if `authentication_type` is 2.\r\n\r\nPlease note: those datasets are only *linked* to the core GTFS, they are not *owned* by it, and therefore the data in `feed_info.txt` doesn't apply to them (e.g. start & end date).\r\n\r\n#### Discussion around the naming of the file\r\nTriMet (Ping @mgilligan & @fpurcell) currently uses the extra file `realtime_feeds.txt` with the fields `url`, `trip_updates`, `service_alerts` and `vehicle_positions`.\r\n\r\nMy current proposal is only different in the naming of the file (`linked_datasets.txt` vs `realtime_feeds.txt`), for two reasons:\r\n- \u201crealtime\u201d: In the future, other URLs will likely be added, and they may not be of \u201creal-time\u201d datasets. Therefore I would avoid setting in stone a limitation which isn\u2019t needed (e.g. ServiceChanges proposal which allow up to 24h changes).\r\n- \u201cFeed\u201d is a misleading word (IMHO) which is currently used in the specification with different meanings depending of the context. It is either a specific dataset (see `feed_info.feed_start_date`) or the set of the different versions of the dataset (see `feed_version` definition). Some open proposal even define \u201cfeed\u201d as being the unique and constant source of the different datasets (see feed_id proposal).\r\n\r\nFor those reasons, I think `linked_datasets.txt` encapsulate unambiguously the content of the new file, without adding any useless limitations for the future.\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\nThis has already been proposed in 2014 in the GTFS-changes Google Group (see [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-changes/m-KIwtNKwOg) and [there](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-changes/zVjEoNIPr_Y)). TriMet is currently using the 2014 proposal in their production feed.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\nFor example, the `linked_datasets.txt` file for Madison Metro Transit (which does not require authentication) would be:\r\n```\r\nurl,trip_updates,vehicle_positions,service_alerts,authentication_type\r\nhttp://transitdata.cityofmadison.com/TripUpdate/TripUpdates.pb,1,0,0,0\r\nhttp://transitdata.cityofmadison.com/Vehicle/VehiclePositions.pb,0,1,0,0\r\nhttp://transitdata.cityofmadison.com/Alert/Alerts.pb,0,0,1,0\r\n```\r\n... and for TriMet (which requires an API key as a URL parameter called `appID` for authentication) it would be:\r\n```\r\nurl,trip_updates,vehicle_positions,service_alerts,authentication_type,authentication_info_url,api_key_parameter_name\r\nhttp://developer.trimet.org/ws/V1/TripUpdate/,1,0,0,2,https://developer.trimet.org/GTFS.shtml,appID\r\nhttp://developer.trimet.org/ws/gtfs/VehiclePositions,0,1,0,2,https://developer.trimet.org/GTFS.shtml,appID\r\nhttp://developer.trimet.org/ws/V1/FeedSpecAlerts/,0,0,1,2,https://developer.trimet.org/GTFS.shtml,appID\r\n```\r\n\r\n... and for Metra in Chicago (which requires ad-hoc authentication not enumerated in our options, in this case via HTTP basic authentication) it would be:\r\n```\r\nurl,trip_updates,vehicle_positions,service_alerts,authentication_type,authentication_info_url\r\nhttps://gtfsapi.metrarail.com/gtfs/raw/tripUpdates.dat,1,0,0,1,https://metrarail.com/developers/metra-gtfs-api\r\nhttps://gtfsapi.metrarail.com/gtfs/raw/positionUpdates.dat,0,1,0,1,https://metrarail.com/developers/metra-gtfs-api\r\nhttps://gtfsapi.metrarail.com/gtfs/raw/alerts.dat,0,0,1,1,https://metrarail.com/developers/metra-gtfs-api\r\n```",

However, both can be accepted in their current form. In the case where a producer doesn't have complete carriage information but knows about updated wheelchair accessibility value, they could provide only this value. \r\n\r\nWe have two agencies who are interested in implementing this with us : STM (Montr\u00e9al) and MBTA (Boston). \r\n\r\nNote : \r\n\r\n- didn't include an spanish doc and protobuf. I can either add it with empty description or will need help to add the full description. \r\n- Value of `WheelchairAccessible` `NO_VALUE` is negative to be able to have the same value in the enum as the static GTFS. However, negative values in a protobuf enum [are discouraged](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#enum) for compression reasons. Since `NO_VALUE` is the default and will not be provided most of the time, I think this is a reasonable tradeoff. \r\n\r\n",

This would differentiate the value from 1, which would become representative of a route that is accessible without additional support. For example, London\u2019s TfL would map their \u201cstep-free to platform\u201d field to this enum, which would cover the entire London Overground stations. Wheelchair-users need to call a staff hotline to get someone to help with a ramp to get on or off the train. Most of the Tokyo overground stations would also be \u201cstep-free to platform\u201d.\r\n\r\nThis field would be valid for both trips.txt and stops.txt.",

There are discussions on the GTFS Realtime mailing list around fully specifying the behavior of DIFFERENTIAL mode and the documentation will be updated when those discussions are finalized.\r\n\r\nBased on a discussion starting in https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/2516#issuecomment-350117175, differential feeds are being used in practice.\r\n\r\nI've opened this issue to start to document behavior for deployed feeds using differential messages, with the goal of working towards a proposal/pull request to better define differential producer/consumer behavior in the GTFS-realtime spec.\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/2516#issuecomment-350306537, @abyrd says:\r\n\r\n>To summarize, our differential GTFS-RT uses trip-level granularity, and the effects of successive messages about the same trip do not accumulate.\r\n>\r\n>An update about a trip is always cleanly applied to the base trip from the original static feed, with no consideration for any previously received message. The differential effect comes from accumulating changes to different trips across the whole data set.\r\n\r\nIf anyone else is producing/consuming differential messages, please add comments here for any design documentation for expected consumer/producer behavior.",

Riders expect this specific ordering of routes when they encounter information about an agency. We cannot infer this order from the ordering of the routes in the dataset, therefore, we need another field in the GTFS to define it.\r\n\r\nCurrently, at least three GTFS producers already add such values in their GTFS: TriMet, MBTA and Trillium (for the PATH dataset). Also, at least one GTFS consumer already uses it: Transit.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n_(Inspired from the MBTA specification)_\r\n\r\n`route.route_sort_order` (Optional): The **route_sort_order** field can be used to order the routes in a way which is ideal for presentation to customers. It must be a non-negative integer.\r\n\r\n### Examples of usage\r\n#### NYC MTA\r\nRoutes are grouped by so-called \"line\"\r\nGood order: ACE BDFM ...\r\nWrong order: ABCDEF...\r\nSource: http://www.mta.info/\r\n\r\n#### Berlin U-Bahn\r\nU55 is a disconnected branch of the U5\r\nGood order: U1, U2, U3, U4, U5, U55, U6, U7, U8, U9\r\nWrong order: U1, U2, U3, U4, U5, U6, U7, U8, U9, U55\r\nSource: http://www.bvg.de/en/Travel-information?#tab-list-0-u\r\n\r\n#### Boston MBTA\r\nMattapan is a distinct route branded as part of the Red Line.\r\nGood order: Green, Orange, Blue, Red, Mattapan, Silver\r\nWrong order (alphabetical): Blue, Green, Mattapan, Orange, Red, Silver\r\nSource: see MBTA GTFS URL below\r\n\r\n(Also, MBTA uses it to force the following ordering: Subway, then BRT, then Bus, then Ferry)\r\n\r\n#### Trois-Rivi\u00e8res STTR (Qu\u00e9bec)\r\nEvery eighty-something route is the night service of the route something.\r\nGood order: 1, 81, 2, 82, 3, 83, 4, 5, 6, 86, ...\r\nWrong order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ..., 81, 82, 83\r\nSource: http://www.sttr.qc.ca/carte.html\r\n\r\n### GTFS producers already using it\r\n#### Boston MBTA\r\nSpecification: http://realtime.mbta.com/Portal/Content/Documents/MBTA_GTFS_Documentation.html\r\nGTFS: https://www.mbta.com/uploadedfiles/MBTA_GTFS.zip\r\n\r\n#### Portland TriMet\r\nSpecification: https://developer.trimet.org/gtfs_ext.shtml\r\nGTFS: https://developer.trimet.org/schedule/gtfs.zip\r\n\r\n#### Trillium in the PATH's GTFS\r\nSpecification: not found (@aantrim are you going to provide one?)\r\nGTFS: http://data.trilliumtransit.com/gtfs/path-nj-us/path-nj-us.zip",

    "body": "The following wording for `stop_time_updates` that have `schedule_relationship` of `SCHEDULED` (or no `schedule_relationship` - `SCHEDULED` is default):\r\n\r\n> If the schedule for this stop contains both arrival and departure times then so must this update\r\n\r\n...is problematic from two perspectives:\r\n\r\n1. **GTFS requires both `arrival_time` and `departure_time` in `stop_times.txt` to be populated** - Looking at https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/spec/en/reference.md#stop_timestxt, it says:\r\n\r\n    >*If you don't have separate times for arrival and departure at a stop, enter the same value for arrival_time and departure_time*.... If this stop is not a timepoint, use either an empty string value for the arrival_time field or provide an interpolated time...Provide arrival times for all stops that are time points...\r\n\r\n    `departure_time` has similar text.\r\n\r\n    So, `arrival_time` and `departure_time` should always be populated, which means that the above wording *always* applies to `stop_time_update` `arrival` and `departure` for `SCHEDULED` (normal) trips.\r\n\r\n2. **There are valid cases where an `arrival` prediction may not exist, but a `departure` does, and vice versa** - For example, for the first stop in a trip, there may not be a rider-facing prediction for when the bus will arrive at that stop, but there is for when it will depart.  And, vice versa for the last stop in the trip.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I'm proposing removing the following text that specifies that both arrival and departure must be populated, which will clarify that providers are allowed to provide only one of the two:\r\n\r\n> If the schedule for this stop contains both arrival and departure times then so must this update\r\n\r\nThis proposal was announced on GTFS-rt Google Group at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-realtime/hHWOJBMyDws.\r\n\r\n**EDIT October 30th 2017**\r\n\r\nReviewing the spec, elsewhere it's clear that arrival *OR* departure can be provided.\r\n\r\n[Stop Time Updates](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/trip-updates.md#stop-time-updates) narrative section says:\r\n\r\n>The update can provide a exact timing for arrival and/or departure at a stop in StopTimeUpdates using StopTimeEvent.\r\n\r\nFrom [StopTimeUpdate](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-stoptimeupdate), for `arrival` and `departure`:\r\n\r\n>If schedule_relationship is empty or SCHEDULED, either arrival or departure must be provided within a StopTimeUpdate - both fields cannot be empty\r\n\r\nThe text I'm proposing to eliminate clearly conflicts with both of these, and is likely left over from an early version of the spec and Google's initial implementation.",

This has created confusion for consumers and producers where fields have been omitted based on them being labeled as \"optional\" in the GTFS-realtime spec, even if they were required under certain logical transit conditions (e.g., stop_sequence must be provided if a trip contains a loop).\r\n* ~~This patch changes the \"Cardinality\" documentation to define the semantic cardinality for each data element as \"required\", \"conditionally required\", and \"optional\", with an explanation for when \"conditionally required\" fields are required in the \"Description\" section of that field.~~ **EDIT** - Field requirements are now being defined in a new field \"Required\" - see https://github.com/google/transit/pull/64#discussion_r124941448 and discussion that follows. It also bumps the gtfs_realtime_version ~~in the .proto file~~ to 2.0 so validators can strictly enforce semantic cardinality based on the gtfs_realtime_version.\r\n\r\nAnnounced on GTFS-realtime Google Group at:\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-realtime/J-csZSxeWjs\r\n\r\n",

Other discussions have recommended using [NTD](https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd) IDs or Transitland [OneStop](https://transit.land/documentation/onestop-id-scheme/) IDs ([example](https://transit.land/feed-registry/operators/o-dr5r-nyct)). The downside of NTD IDs that feeds can contain multiple agencies. I recommend that the spec remain silent on the subject of some kind of global GTFS registry, both because GTFS is decentralized by nature and because some feeds already supply `feed_id`. More important than global uniqueness is local uniqueness. Quoting from Andrew Byrd from the above thread:\r\n\r\n> But if we look at this pragmatically, what really matters is that within a single coverage area (city, regional, or continental) there is some widely recognized unique name for each feed that interacts with other outside data sources. Basically feeds with realtime data in regions with multiple feeds would truly need to use feed IDs for this to function.",

Under this interpretation, if one of the entity timestamps is ahead of the header timestamp, then either the header timestamp is wrong or the entity timestamp is wrong.\r\n\r\nFor additional context, we're adding this as either a warning or error in our GTFS-rt validation tool:\r\nhttps://github.com/CUTR-at-USF/gtfs-realtime-validator",

Allowed values are:\r\n> - blank: no position defined (default value);\r\n> - **NS**: near side of the intersection;\r\n> - **FS**: far side of the intersection;\r\n> - **AT**: stop is at position;\r\n> - **OP**: stop is across the street.\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a merge of different sources:\r\n- The GTFS+ proposal of a `stop_attributes.relative_position`:  http://www.transitwiki.org/TransitWiki/images/e/e7/GTFS+_Additional_Files_Format_Ver_1.7.pdf\r\n- The TriMet proposal (Portland, US-OR) of a `stops.position`: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-changes/LlduFqXj9pg\r\n\r\n[Edited 2017-02-16 20:19 EST: add \"Current issue\" and \"Goals\" sections]",

This conflation makes it very difficult and confusing to discuss any concept related to frequencies.txt.\r\n\r\nThis proposal clearly specifies the difference between `exact_times`=0 vs 1 trips using the following definitions:\r\n* `exact_times`=0 trips are the only trips referred to as \"frequency-based\"\r\n* `exact_times`=1 trips are referred to as \"headway-defined schedules\"\r\n* When `exact_times` 0 and 1 trips are both referenced, this proposal refers to them as \"trips defined in frequencies.txt\" (instead of \"frequency-based trips\")\r\n\r\nAnnounced on the gtfs-changes list at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-changes/tgRrog7wM78.",

Therefore, we want to take care to only add features that we know to be useful. Ideally, any proposal will have been tested by generating data for a real transit system that uses the new feature and writing software to read and display it.\r\n\r\nNow that we have a formal process for changes, I'd like to include this principle within the steps to ensure it's reviewed by all proposing parties.  I've proposed this as a pre-requisite step before calling for a vote, but I'm open to better ideas as well.\r\n\r\nProposal announced on gtfs-changes list here:\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-changes/L_02vz71Ib4",

    "body": "This is a proof-of-concept PR showing the ability to host the GTFS HTML docs in the same Github repository as the canonical markdown.\r\n\r\n~This PR contains the HTML source for the page:~\r\n~https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/~\r\n\r\n~The contents of this PR can be seen rendered by visiting:~\r\n~http://barbeau.github.io/transit/gtfs-realtime/~\r\n\r\n~If merged, the site would be visible at:~\r\n~http://google.github.io/transit/gtfs-realtime/~\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is to explore possible ways that contributors outside of Google could help streamline the process to update the HTML docs.  Currently there are four PRs dating back to Nov. 2015 that have been accepted and merged in this repo, but the HTML docs were never updated:\r\n- https://github.com/google/transit/pull/15\r\n- https://github.com/google/transit/pull/16\r\n- https://github.com/google/transit/pull/18\r\n- https://github.com/google/transit/pull/20\r\n\r\nThis is a problem because many users consider the GTFS HTML docs the canonical source for the spec.\r\n\r\nGTFS-realtime group post at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-realtime/Gl933YAr4js.\r\n\r\n~**Process change options**~\r\n~1. **Contribute proposal changes to markdown and HTML** - Using a github.io site, contributors could propose changes in the HTML docs along with the changes in the markdown in the same PR.  Then, when the PR is merged it would automatically update the HTML (**EDIT** - because the HTML pages need to be in a separate `gh-pages` branch, and Github PRs only support one branch per PR, markdown and HTML edits would actually need to be split into two PRs).~\r\n~2. **Change to using HTML docs as canonical document, get rid of markdown** - This would avoid duplication of effort in editing both markdown and HTML, but at the cost of readability of the source documents - the HTML source is much harder to read and edit by hand than markdown (IMHO).  IDEs can help with this, but it raises the learning curve for contributing.~\r\n\r\n**EDIT Dec. 12, 2016**\r\n\r\nGithub will render markdown as HTML, so we shouldn't need to keep a separate Markdown and HTML version of the spec.\r\n\r\nYou can see an example of this here:\r\nhttp://barbeau.github.io/transit/\r\n\r\nIt renders the main markdown README as:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n  <head>\r\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\r\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\r\n    <title></title>\r\n    <link href=\"http://barbeau.github.io/transit/assets/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\r\n  </head>\r\n  <body>\r\n    <div class=\"container\">\r\n      <p>The repository contains specification and tools to manipulate General Transit\r\nFeed Specification (GTFS) and GTFS Realtime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please visit https://developers.google.com/transit/ for information.</p>\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n~~~\r\n",

    "body": "In the \"Stop Time Updates\" section, the [GTFS-realtime spec](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/trip-updates#stop-time-updates) says:\n\n> A trip update consists of one or more updates to vehicle stop times, which are referred to as StopTimeUpdates. These can be supplied for past and future stop times. You are allowed, but not required, to drop past stop times. When doing this, be aware that you shouldn't drop a past update if it refers to a trip that isn't yet scheduled to have finished (i.e. it finished ahead of schedule) as otherwise it will be concluded that there is no update on this trip.\u201d\n\nMy interpretation of the highlighted portion is that when multiple StopTimeUpdates exist in a trip (i.e., per-stop predictions), individual StopTimeUpdates shouldn't be dropped from the GTFS-rt feed if the vehicle is running ahead of schedule until _after_ the scheduled arrival time for that stop (from GTFS stop_times.txt).\n\nFor example, if the following data appears in the GTFS-rt feed:\n- Stop 4 \u2013Predicted at 10:18am (scheduled at 10:20am \u2013 2 min early)\n- Stop 5 \u2013Predicted at 10:30am (scheduled at 10:30am \u2013 on time)\n\n...the prediction for Stop 4 cannot be dropped from the feed until 10:21am, even if the bus actually passes the stop at 10:18am.  If the StopTimeUpdates for Stop 4 was dropped from the feed at 10:18am or 10:19am, and the scheduled arrival time is 10:20am, then the consumer should assume that no real-time information exists for Stop 4 at that time.\n\nA vendor is arguing that this text applies only to the TripUpdate, not to the StopTimeUpdates, and they are allowed to drop updates for vehicles running early as soon as the vehicle passes the stop (no matter what the scheduled arrival time is).  If the vendor's interpretation is correct, it results in a very poor end user experience for consumers - for example, if a vehicle was running 5 minutes early, and the user checks their app 4 minutes before the scheduled arrival time, the app would only show scheduled information, and would show that the vehicle was expected to arrive in 4 minutes (even though at a system level we know that the vehicle already passed the stop).\n\nI'm proposing this change to clarify the expected behavior in the context of dropping StopTimeUpdates with a vehicle running ahead of schedule.\n\nSee also https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-realtime/3rAf6UIhAsQ.\n",
