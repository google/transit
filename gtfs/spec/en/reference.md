## Term Definitions

This section defines terms that are used throughout this document.


* **Dataset** - A complete set of files defined by this specification reference. Altering the dataset creates a new version of the dataset. Datasets should be published at a public, permanent URL, including the zip file name. (e.g., https://www.agency.org/gtfs/gtfs.zip).
* **Record** - A basic data structure comprised of a number of different field values describing a single entity (e.g. transit agency, stop, route, etc.). Represented, in a table, as a row.
* **Field** - A property of an object or entity. Represented, in a table, as a column.
* **Field Value** - An individual entry in a field. Represented, in a table, as a single cell.
* **Required** - The field must be included in the dataset, and a value must be provided in that field for each record. Some required fields permit an empty string as a value (denoted in this specification as empty). To enter an empty string, just omit any text between the commas for that field.
* **Optional** - The field may be omitted from the dataset. If an optional column is included, some of the entries in that field may be empty strings. To enter an empty string, just omit any text between the commas for that field. Note that an omitted field is equivalent to a field that is entirely empty.
* **Conditionally required** - The field or file is required under certain conditions, which are outlined in the field or file description. Outside of these conditions, this field or file is optional.
* **Service day** - A service day is a time period used to indicate route scheduling. The exact definition of service day varies from agency to agency but service days often do not correspond with calendar days. A service day may exceed 24:00:00 if service begins on one day and ends on a following day. For example, service that runs from 08:00:00 on Friday to 02:00:00 on Saturday, could be denoted as running from 08:00:00 to 26:00:00 on a single service day.

## Field Types

- **Color** - A color encoded as a six-digit hexadecimal number. Refer to [https://htmlcolorcodes.com](https://htmlcolorcodes.com) to generate a valid value (the leading "#" is not included). <br> *Example: `FFFFFF` for white, `000000` for black or `0039A6` for the A,C,E lines in NYMTA.*
- **Currency Code** - An ISO 4217 alphabetical currency code. For the list of current currency, refer to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active\_codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes). <br> *Example: `CAD` for Canadian dollars, `EUR` for euros or `JPY` for Japanese yen.*
- **Date** - Service day in the YYYYMMDD format. Since time within a service day can be above 24:00:00, a service day often contains information for the subsequent day(s). <br> *Example: `20180913` for September 13th, 2018.*
- **Email** - An email address. <br> *Example: `example@example.com`*
- **Enum** - An option from a set of predefined constants defined in the "Description" column. <br> *Example: The `route_type` field contains a `0` for tram, a `1` for subway...*
- **ID** - A sequence of any UTF-8 characters which uniquely identifies an entity, but does not necessarily identify a specific record in a table. IDs defined in one .txt file are often referenced in another .txt file. An ID field value is not aimed to be displayed to the user, and is a sequence of any UTF-8 characters, but using only printable ASCII characters is recommended. <br> *Example: The `stop_id` field in [stops.txt](#stopstxt) is a ID. The `stop_id` field in [stop_times.txt](#stop_timestxt) is an ID referencing `stops.stop_id`.*
- **Language Code** - An IETF BCP 47 language code. For an introduction to IETF BCP 47, refer to [http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) and [http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/](http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/). <br> *Example: `en` for English, `en-US` for American English or `de` for German.*
- **Latitude** - WGS84 latitude in decimal degrees. The value must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to 90.0. *<br> Example: `41.890169` for the Colosseum in Rome.*
- **Longitude** - WGS84 longitude in decimal degrees. The value must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to 180.0. <br> *Example: `12.492269` for the Colosseum in Rome.*
- **Non-negative Float** - A floating point number greater than or equal to 0.
- **Non-negative Integer** - A integer greater than or equal to 0.
- **Phone number** - A phone number.
- **Time** - Time in the HH:MM:SS format (H:MM:SS is also accepted). The time is measured from "noon minus 12h" of the service day (effectively midnight except for days on which daylight savings time changes occur). For times occurring after midnight, enter the time as a value greater than 24:00:00 in HH:MM:SS local time for the day on which the trip schedule begins. <br> *Example: `14:30:00` for 2:30PM or `25:35:00` for 1:35AM on the next day.*
- **Text** - A string of UTF-8 characters, which is aimed to be displayed and which must therefore be human readable.
- **Timezone** - TZ timezone from the [https://www.iana.org/time-zones](https://www.iana.org/time-zones). Timezone names never contain the space character but may contain an underscore. Refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_tz\_zones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_tz\_zones) for a list of valid values. <br> *Example: `Asia/Tokyo`, `America/Los_Angeles` or `Africa/Cairo`.*
- **URL** - A fully qualified URL that includes http:// or https://, and any special characters in the URL must be correctly escaped. See the following [http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4\_URI\_Recommentations.html](http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4\_URI\_Recommentations.html) for a description of how to create fully qualified URL values.

## Dataset Files

This specification defines the following files:

|  Filename | Required | Defines |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  [agency.txt](#agencytxt) | **Required** | Transit agencies with service represented in this dataset. |
|  [stops.txt](#stopstxt) | **Required** | Stops where vehicles pick up or drop off riders. Also defines stations and station entrances.  |
|  [routes.txt](#routestxt) | **Required** | Transit routes. A route is a group of trips that are displayed to riders as a single service. |
|  [trips.txt](#tripstxt)  | **Required** | Trips for each route. A trip is a sequence of two or more stops that occur during a specific time period. |
|  [stop_times.txt](#stop_timestxt)  | **Required** | Times that a vehicle arrives at and departs from stops for each trip. |
|  [calendar.txt](#calendartxt)  | **Conditionally required** | Service dates specified using a weekly schedule with start and end dates. This file is required unless all dates of service are defined in [calendar_dates.txt](#calendar_datestxt). |
|  [calendar_dates.txt](#calendar_datestxt)  | **Conditionally required** | Exceptions for the services defined in the [calendar.txt](#calendartxt). If [calendar.txt](#calendartxt) is omitted, then [calendar_dates.txt](#calendar_datestxt) is required and must contain all dates of service. |
|  [fare_attributes.txt](#fare_attributestxt)  | Optional | Fare information for a transit agency's routes. |
|  [fare_rules.txt](#fare_rulestxt)  | Optional | Rules to apply fares for itineraries. |
|  [shapes.txt](#shapestxt)  | Optional | Rules for mapping vehicle travel paths, sometimes referred to as route alignments. |
|  [frequencies.txt](#frequenciestxt)  | Optional | Headway (time between trips) for headway-based service or a compressed representation of fixed-schedule service. |
|  [transfers.txt](#transferstxt)  | Optional | Rules for making connections at transfer points between routes. |
|  [pathways.txt](#pathwaystxt)  | Optional | Pathways linking together locations within stations. |
|  [levels.txt](#levelstxt)  | Optional | Levels within stations. |
|  [feed_info.txt](#feed_infotxt)  | Optional | Dataset metadata, including publisher, version, and expiration information. |

## File Requirements

The following requirements apply to the format and contents of the dataset files:

* All files must be saved as comma-delimited text.
* The first line of each file must contain field names. Each subsection of the [Field Definitions](#field-definitions) section corresponds to one of the files in a GTFS dataset and lists the field names that may be used in that file.
* All field names are case-sensitive.
* Field values may not contain tabs, carriage returns or new lines.
* Field values that contain quotation marks or commas must be enclosed within quotation marks. In addition, each quotation mark in the field value must be preceded with a quotation mark. This is consistent with the manner in which Microsoft Excel outputs comma-delimited (CSV) files. For more information on the CSV file format, see [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180).
The following example demonstrates how a field value would appear in a comma-delimited file:
  * **Original field value:** `Contains "quotes", commas and text`
  * **Field value in CSV file:** `"Contains ""quotes"", commas and text"`
* Field values must not contain HTML tags, comments or escape sequences.
* Remove any extra spaces between fields or field names. Many parsers consider the spaces to be part of the value, which may cause errors.
* Each line must end with a CRLF or LF linebreak character.
* Files should be encoded in UTF-8 to support all Unicode characters. Files that include the Unicode byte-order mark (BOM) character are acceptable. See [http://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#BOM](http://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#BOM) for more information on the BOM character and UTF-8.
* All dataset files must be zipped together.

File: **Required**

|  Field Name | Type | Required | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `agency_id` | ID | **Conditionally Required** | Identifies a transit brand which is often synonymous with a transit agency. Note that in some cases, such as when a single agency operates multiple separate services, agencies and brands are distinct. This document uses the term "agency" in place of "brand".

### stops.txt

File: **Required**

|  Field Name | Type | Required | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `stop_id` | ID | **Required** | Identifies a stop, station, or station entrance. The term "station entrance" refers to both station entrances and station exits. Stops, stations or station entrances are collectively referred to as locations. Multiple routes may use the same stop. |
|  `stop_code` | Text | Optional | Short text or a number that identifies the location for riders. These codes are often used in phone-based transit information systems or printed on signage to make it easier for riders to get information for a particular location. The `stop_code` can be the same as `stop_id` if it is public facing. This field should be left empty for locations without a code presented to riders. |
|  `stop_name` | Text | **Conditionally Required** | Name of the location. Use a name that people will understand in the local and tourist vernacular.<br><br>When the location is a boarding area (`location_type=4`), the `stop_name` should contains the name of the boarding area as displayed by the agency. It could be just one letter (like on some European intercity railway stations), or text like “Wheelchair boarding area” (NYC’s Subway) or “Head of short trains” (Paris’ RER).<br><br>Conditionally Required:<br>• **Required** for locations which are stops (`location_type=0`), stations (`location_type=1`) or entrances/exits (`location_type=2`).<br>• Optional for locations which are generic nodes (`location_type=3`) or boarding areas (`location_type=4`).|
|  `stop_desc` | Text | Optional | Description of the location that provides useful, quality information. Do not simply duplicate the name of the location. |
|  `stop_lat` | Latitude | **Conditionally Required** | Latitude of the location.<br><br>Conditionally Required:<br>• **Required** for locations which are stops (`location_type=0`), stations (`location_type=1`) or entrances/exits (`location_type=2`).<br>• Optional for locations which are generic nodes (`location_type=3`) or boarding areas (`location_type=4`).|
|  `stop_lon` | Longitude | **Conditionally Required** | Longitude of the location.<br><br>Conditionally Required:<br>• **Required** for locations which are stops (`location_type=0`), stations (`location_type=1`) or entrances/exits (`location_type=2`).<br>• Optional for locations which are generic nodes (`location_type=3`) or boarding areas (`location_type=4`). | 
|  `zone_id` | ID | **Conditionally Required** | Identifies the fare zone for a stop. This field is required if providing fare information using [fare_rules.txt](#fare_rulestxt), otherwise it is optional. If this record represents a station or station entrance, the `zone_id` is ignored. |
|  `stop_url` | URL | Optional | URL of a web page about the location. This should be different from the `agency.agency_url` and the `routes.route_url` field values. |
|  `location_type` | Enum | Optional | Type of the location:<br>• `0` (or blank): **Stop** (or **Platform**). A location where passengers board or disembark from a transit vehicle. Is called a platform when defined within a `parent_station`.<br>• `1`: **Station**. A physical structure or area that contains one or more platform.<br>• `2`: **Entrance/Exit**. A location where passengers can enter or exit a station from the street. If an entrance/exit belongs to multiple stations, it can be linked by pathways to both, but the data provider must pick one of them as parent.<br>• `3`: **Generic Node**. A location within a station, not matching any other `location_type`, which can be used to link together pathways define in pathways.txt.<br>• `4`: **Boarding Area**. A specific location on a platform, where passengers can board and/or alight vehicles.|
|  `parent_station` | ID referencing `stops.stop_id` | **Conditionally Required** | Defines hierarchy between the different locations defined in `stops.txt`. It contains the ID of the parent location, as followed:<br>• **Stop/platform** (`location_type=0`): the `parent_station` field contains the ID of a station.<br>• **Station** (`location_type=1`): this field must be empty.<br>• **Entrance/exit** (`location_type=2`) or **generic node** (`location_type=3`): the `parent_station` field contains the ID of a station (`location_type=1`)<br>• **Boarding Area** (`location_type=4`): the `parent_station` field contains ID of a platform.<br><br>Conditionally Required:<br>• **Required** for locations which are entrances (`location_type=2`), generic nodes (`location_type=3`) or boarding areas (`location_type=4`).<br>• Optional for stops/platforms (`location_type=0`).<br>• Forbidden for stations (`location_type=1`).|
|  `stop_timezone` | Timezone | Optional | Timezone of the location. If the location has a parent station, it inherits the parent station’s timezone instead of applying its own. Stations and parentless stops with empty `stop_timezone` inherit the timezone specified by `agency.agency_timezone`. If `stop_timezone` values are provided, the times in [stop_times.txt](#stop_timetxt) should be entered as the time since midnight in the timezone specified by `agency.agency_timezone`. This ensures that the time values in a trip always increase over the course of a trip, regardless of which timezones the trip crosses. |
|  `wheelchair_boarding` | Enum | Optional | Indicates whether wheelchair boardings are possible from the location. Valid options are: <br><br>For parentless stops:<br>`0` or empty - No accessibility information for the stop.<br>`1` - Some vehicles at this stop can be boarded by a rider in a wheelchair.<br>`2` - Wheelchair boarding is not possible at this stop. <br><br>For child stops: <br>`0` or empty - Stop will inherit its `wheelchair_boarding` behavior from the parent station, if specified in the parent.<br>`1` - There exists some accessible path from outside the station to the specific stop/platform.<br>`2` - There exists no accessible path from outside the station to the specific stop/platform.<br><br> For station entrances/exits: <br>`0` or empty - Station entrance will inherit its `wheelchair_boarding` behavior from the parent station, if specified for the parent.<br>`1` - Station entrance is wheelchair accessible.<br>`2` - No accessible path from station entrance to stops/platforms. |
|  `level_id` | ID referencing `levels.level_id` | Optional | Level of the location. The same level can be used by multiple unlinked stations.|

### routes.txt

|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `route_id` | ID | **Required** | Identifies a route. |
|  `agency_id` | ID referencing `agency.agency_id` | **Conditionally required** | Agency for the specified route. This field is required when the dataset provides data for routes from more than one agency in [agency.txt](#agency), otherwise it is optional.  |
|  `route_short_name` | Text | **Conditionally required** | Short name of a route. This will often be a short, abstract identifier like "32", "100X", or "Green" that riders use to identify a route, but which doesn't give any indication of what places the route serves. Either `route_short_name` or `route_long_name` must be specified, or potentially both if appropriate. |
|  `route_long_name` | Text | **Conditionally required** | Full name of a route. This name is generally more descriptive than the `route_short_name` and often includes the route's destination or stop. Either `route_short_name` or `route_long_name` must be specified, or potentially both if appropriate. |
|  `route_desc` | Text | Optional | Description of a route that provides useful, quality information. Do not simply duplicate the name of the route. <hr> _Example: "A" trains operate between Inwood-207 St, Manhattan and Far Rockaway-Mott Avenue, Queens at all times. Also from about 6AM until about midnight, additional "A" trains operate between Inwood-207 St and Lefferts Boulevard (trains typically alternate between Lefferts Blvd and Far Rockaway)._ |
|  `route_type` | Enum | **Required** | Indicates the type of transportation used on a route. Valid options are: <br><br>`0` - Tram, Streetcar, Light rail. Any light rail or street level system within a metropolitan area.<br>`1` - Subway, Metro. Any underground rail system within a metropolitan area.<br>`2` - Rail. Used for intercity or long-distance travel.<br>`3` - Bus. Used for short- and long-distance bus routes.<br>`4` - Ferry. Used for short- and long-distance boat service.<br>`5` - Cable car. Used for street-level cable cars where the cable runs beneath the car.<br>`6` - Gondola, Suspended cable car. Typically used for aerial cable cars where the car is suspended from the cable.<br>`7` - Funicular. Any rail system designed for steep inclines. |
|  `route_url` | URL | Optional | URL of a web page about the particular route. Should be different from the `agency.agency_url` value. |
|  `route_color` | Color | Optional | Route color designation that matches public facing material. Defaults to white (`FFFFFF`) when omitted or left empty. The color difference between `route_color` and `route_text_color` should provide sufficient contrast when viewed on a black and white screen. |
|  `route_text_color` | Color | Optional | Legible color to use for text drawn against a background of `route_color`. Defaults to black (`000000`) when omitted or left empty. The color difference between `route_color` and `route_text_color` should provide sufficient contrast when viewed on a black and white screen. |
|  `route_sort_order` | Non-negative integer | Optional | Orders the routes in a way which is ideal for presentation to customers. Routes with smaller `route_sort_order` values should be displayed first. |

### trips.txt

|  `trip_id` | ID | **Required** | Identifies a trip. |
|  `trip_headsign` | Text | Optional | Text that appears on signage identifying the trip's destination to riders. Use this field to distinguish between different patterns of service on the same route. If the headsign changes during a trip, `trip_headsign` can be overridden by specifying values for the `stop_times.stop_headsign`. |
|  `trip_short_name` | Text | Optional | Public facing text used to identify the trip to riders, for instance, to identify train numbers for commuter rail trips. If riders do not commonly rely on trip names, leave this field empty.  A `trip_short_name` value, if provided, should uniquely identify a trip within a service day; it should not be used for destination names or limited/express designations. |
|  `direction_id` | Enum | Optional | Indicates the direction of travel for a trip. This field is not used in routing; it provides a way to separate trips by direction when publishing time tables. Valid options are: <br><br>`0` - Travel in one direction (e.g. outbound travel).<br>`1` - Travel in the opposite direction (e.g. inbound travel).<hr>*Example: The `trip_headsign` and `direction_id` fields could be used together to assign a name to travel in each direction for a set of trips. A [trips.txt](#tripstxt) file could contain these records for use in time tables:* <br> `trip_id,...,trip_headsign,direction_id` <br> `1234,...,Airport,0` <br> `1505,...,Downtown,1` |
|  `block_id` | ID | Optional | Identifies the block to which the trip belongs. A block consists of a single trip or many sequential trips made using the same vehicle, defined by shared service days and `block_id`.

Notes on above table:

* On Friday into Saturday morning, for example, a single vehicle operates `trip_1`, `trip_2`, and `trip_3` (10:00 PM through 12:55 AM). Note that the last trip occurs on Saturday, 12:00 AM to 12:55 AM, but is part of the Friday “service day” because the times are 24:00:00 to 24:55:00.
* On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, a single vehicle operates `trip_1`, `trip_4`, and `trip_5` in a block from 8:00 PM to 10:55 PM.

### stop_times.txt

File: **Required**

|  Field Name | Type | Required | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `trip_id` | ID referencing `trips.trip_id` | **Required** | Identifies a trip.  |
|  `arrival_time` | Time | **Conditionally required** | Arrival time at a specific stop for a specific trip on a route. If there are not separate times for arrival and departure at a stop, enter the same value for `arrival_time` and `departure_time`. For times occurring after midnight on the service day, enter the time as a value greater than 24:00:00 in HH:MM:SS local time for the day on which the trip schedule begins.<br/><br/>Scheduled stops where the vehicle strictly adheres to the specified arrival and departure times are timepoints. If this stop is not a timepoint, use leave `arrival_time` empty or provide an interpolated time. Further, indicate that interpolated times are provided with `timepoint`=`0`. If interpolated times are indicated with `timepoint`=`0`, then time points must be indicated with `timepoint`=`1`. Provide arrival times for all stops that are time points. An arrival time must be specified for the first and the last stop in a trip. |
|  `departure_time` | Time | **Conditionally required** | Departure time from a specific stop for a specific trip on a route. For times occurring after midnight on the service day, enter the time as a value greater than 24:00:00 in HH:MM:SS local time for the day on which the trip schedule begins. If there are not separate times for arrival and departure at a stop, enter the same value for `arrival_time` and `departure_time`. See the `arrival_time` description for more details about using timepoints correctly. |
|  `stop_id` | ID referencing `stops.stop_id` | **Required** | Identifies the serviced stop. All stops serviced during a trip must have a record in [stop_times.txt](#stop_timestxt). Referenced locations must be stops, not stations or station entrances. A stop may be serviced multiple times in the same trip, and multiple trips and routes may service the same stop. |
|  `stop_sequence` | Non-negative integer | **Required** | Order of stops for a particular trip. The values must increase along the trip but do not need to be consecutive.<hr>*Example: The first location on the trip could have a `stop_sequence`=`1`, the second location on the trip could have a `stop_sequence`=`23`, the third location could have a `stop_sequence`=`40`, and so on.* |
|  `stop_headsign` | Text | Optional | Text that appears on signage identifying the trip's destination to riders. This field overrides the default `trips.trip_headsign` when the headsign changes between stops. If the headsign is displayed for an entire trip, use `trips.trip_headsign` instead. |
|  `pickup_type` | Enum | Optional | Indicates drop off method. Valid options are:<br><br>`0` or empty - Regularly scheduled pickup. <br>`1` - No pickup available.<br>`2` - Must phone agency to arrange pickup.<br>`3` - Must coordinate with driver to arrange pickup. |

|  `shape_dist_traveled` | Non-negative float | Optional | Actual distance traveled along the associated shape, from the first stop to the stop specified in this record. This field specifies how much of the shape to draw between any two stops during a trip. Must be in the same units used in [shapes.txt](#shapestxt). Values used for `shape_dist_traveled` must increase along with `stop_sequence`; they cannot be used to show reverse travel along a route.<hr>*Example: If a bus travels a distance of 5.25 kilometers from the start of the shape to the stop,`shape_dist_traveled`=`5.25`.*|
|  `timepoint` | Enum | Optional | Indicates if arrival and departure times for a stop are strictly adhered to by the vehicle or if they are instead approximate and/or interpolated times. This field allows a GTFS producer to provide interpolated stop-times, while indicating that the times are approximate. Valid options are:<br><br>`0` - Times are considered approximate.<br>`1` or empty - Times are considered exact. |


### calendar.txt

File: **Conditionally required**

|  Field Name | Type | Required | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ |------ |
|  `service_id` | ID | **Required** | Uniquely identifies a set of dates when service is available for one or more routes. Each `service_id` value can appear at most once in a [calendar.txt](#calendartxt) file. |
|  `monday` | Enum | **Required** | Indicates whether the service operates on all Mondays in the date range specified by the `start_date` and `end_date` fields. Note that exceptions for particular dates may be listed in [calendar_dates.txt](#calendar_datestxt). Valid options are:<br><br>`1` - Service is available for all Mondays in the date range.<br>`0` - Service is not available for Mondays in the date range. |
|  `tuesday` | Enum | **Required** | Functions in the same way as `monday` except applies to Tuesdays |
|  `wednesday` | Enum | **Required** | Functions in the same way as `monday` except applies to Wednesdays  |
|  `thursday` | Enum | **Required** | Functions in the same way as `monday` except applies to Thursdays  |
|  `friday` | Enum | **Required** | Functions in the same way as `monday` except applies to Fridays  |

|  `end_date` | Date | **Required** | End service day for the service interval. This service day is included in the interval. |

### calendar_dates.txt

File: **Conditionally required**

The [calendar_dates.txt](#calender_datestxt) table can explicitly activate or disable service by date. It can be used in two ways.

* Recommended: Use [calendar_dates.txt](#calender_datestxt) in conjunction with [calendar.txt](#calendartxt) to define exceptions to the default service patterns defined in [calendar.txt](#calendartxt). If service is generally regular, with a few changes on explicit dates (for instance, to accommodate special event services, or a school schedule), this is a good approach. In this case `calendar_dates.service_id` is an ID referencing `calendar.service_id`.
* Alternate: Omit [calendar.txt](#calendartxt), and specify each date of service in [calendar_dates.txt](#calenderdatestxt). This allows for considerable service variation and accommodates service without normal weekly schedules. In this case `service_id` is an ID.

|  Field Name | Type | Required | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `service_id` | ID referencing `calendar.service_id` or ID | **Required** | Identifies a set of dates when a service exception occurs for one or more routes. Each (`service_id`, `date`) pair can only appear once in [calendar_dates.txt](#calender_datestxt) if using [calendar.txt](#calendartxt) and [calendar_dates.txt](#calender_datestxt) in conjunction. If a `service_id` value appears in both [calendar.txt](#calendartxt) and [calendar_dates.txt](#calender_datestxt), the information in [calendar_dates.txt](#calenderdatestxt) modifies the service information specified in [calendar.txt](#calendartxt). |
|  `date` | Date | **Required** | Date when service exception occurs. |
|  `exception_type` | Enum | **Required** | Indicates whether service is available on the date specified in the date field. Valid options are:<br><br> `1` - Service has been added for the specified date.<br>`2` - Service has been removed for the specified date.<hr>*Example: Suppose a route has one set of trips available on holidays and another set of trips available on all other days. One `service_id` could correspond to the regular service schedule and another `service_id` could correspond to the holiday schedule. For a particular holiday, the [calendar_dates.txt](#calender_datestxt) file could be used to add the holiday to the holiday `service_id` and to remove the holiday from the regular `service_id` schedule.* |

|  `transfers` | Enum | **Required** | Indicates the number of transfers permitted on this fare. The fact that this field can be left empty is an exception to the requirement that a Required field must not be empty. Valid options are:<br><br>`0` - No transfers permitted on this fare.<br>`1` - Riders may transfer once.<br>`2` - Riders may transfer twice.<br>empty - Unlimited transfers are permitted. |
|  `agency_id` | ID referencing `agency.agency_id` | **Conditionally Required** | Identifies the relevant agency for a fare. This field is required for datasets with multiple agencies defined in [agency.txt](#agencytxt), otherwise it is optional. |
|  `transfer_duration` | Non-negative integer | Optional | Length of time in seconds before a transfer expires. When `transfers`=`0` this field can be used to indicate how long a ticket is valid for or it can can be left empty. |

### fare_rules.txt

File: **Optional**

The [fare_rules.txt](#farerulestxt) table specifies how fares in [fare_attributes.txt](#fare_attributestxt) apply to an itinerary. Most fare structures use some combination of the following rules:

* Fare depends on origin or destination stations.
* Fare depends on which zones the itinerary passes through.
* Fare depends on which route the itinerary uses.

For examples that demonstrate how to specify a fare structure with [fare_rules.txt](#farerulestxt) and [fare_attributes.txt](#fareattributestxt), see [https://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/wiki/FareExamples](https://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/wiki/FareExamples) in the GoogleTransitDataFeed open source project wiki.

|  Field Name | Type | Required | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `fare_id` | ID referencing `fare_attributes.fare_id`  | **Required** | Identifies a fare class. |
|  `route_id` | ID referencing `routes.routes_id` | Optional | Identifies a route associated with the fare class. If several routes with the same fare attributes exist, create a record in [fare_rules.txt](#fare_rules.txt) for each route.<hr>*Example: If fare class "b" is valid on route "TSW" and "TSE", the [fare_rules.txt](#fare_rules.txt) file would contain these records for the fare class:* <br> ` fare_id,route_id`<br>`b,TSW` <br> `b,TSE`|
|  `origin_id` | ID referencing `stops.zone_id` | Optional | Identifies an origin zone. If a fare class has multiple origin zones, create a record in [fare_rules.txt](#fare_rules.txt) for each `origin_id`.<hr>*Example: If fare class "b" is valid for all travel originating from either zone "2" or zone "8", the [fare_rules.txt](#fare_rules.txt) file would contain these records for the fare class:* <br> `fare_id,...,origin_id` <br> `b,...,2`  <br> `b,...,8` |
|  `destination_id` | ID referencing `stops.zone_id` | Optional | Identifies a destination zone. If a fare class has multiple destination zones, create a record in [fare_rules.txt](#fare_rules.txt) for each `destination_id`.<hr>*Example: The `origin_id` and `destination_id` fields could be used together to specify that fare class "b" is valid for travel between zones 3 and 4, and for travel between zones 3 and 5, the [fare_rules.txt](#fare_rules.txt) file would contain these records for the fare class:* <br>`fare_id,...,origin_id,destination_id` <br>`b,...,3,4`<br> `b,...,3,5` |
|  `contains_id` | ID referencing `stops.zone_id` | Optional | Identifies the zones that a rider will enter while using a given fare class. Used in some systems to calculate correct fare class. <hr>*Example: If fare class "c" is associated with all travel on the GRT route that passes through zones 5, 6, and 7 the [fare_rules.txt](#fare_rules.txt) would contain these records:* <br> `zone_id,route_id,...,contains_id` <br>  `c,GRT,...,5` <br>`c,GRT,...,6` <br>`c,GRT,...,7` <br> *Because all `contains_id` zones must be matched for the fare to apply, an itinerary that passes through zones 5 and 6 but not zone 7 would not have fare class "c". For more detail, see [https://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/wiki/FareExamples](https://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/wiki/FareExamples) in the GoogleTransitDataFeed project wiki.* |

### shapes.txt

File: **Optional**

Shapes describe the physical path that a vehicle takes as a set of ordered latitude and longitude coordinates.  Tracing the coordinates in order provides the vehicle's path. Coordinates do not need to match stop locations.

|  Field Name | Type | Required | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `shape_id` | ID | **Required** | Identifies a shape. |
|  `shape_pt_lat` | Latitude | **Required** | Latitude of a shape point. Each record in [shapes.txt](#shapestxt) represents a shape point used to define the shape. |
|  `shape_pt_lon` | Longitude | **Required** | Longitude of a shape point. |
|  `shape_pt_sequence` | Non-negative integer | **Required** | Sequence in which the shape points connect to form the shape. Values must increase along the trip but do not need to be consecutive.<hr>*Example: If the shape "A_shp" has three points in its definition, the [shapes.txt](#shapestxt) file might contain these records to define the shape:* <br> `shape_id,shape_pt_lat,shape_pt_lon,shape_pt_sequence` <br> `A_shp,37.61956,-122.48161,0` <br> `A_shp,37.64430,-122.41070,6` <br> `A_shp,37.65863,-122.30839,11` |
|  `shape_dist_traveled` | Non-negative float | Optional | Actual distance traveled along the shape from the first shape point to the point specified in this record. Used by trip planners to show the correct portion of the shape on a map. Values must increase along with `shape_pt_sequence`; they cannot be used to show reverse travel along a route. Distance units must be consistent with those used in [stop_times.txt](#stop_timestxt).<hr>*Example: If a bus travels along the three points defined above for A_shp, the additional `shape_dist_traveled` values (shown here in kilometers) would look like this:* <br> `shape_id,shape_pt_lat,shape_pt_lon,shape_pt_sequence,shape_dist_traveled` <br> `A_shp,37.61956,-122.48161,0,0`<br>`A_shp,37.64430,-122.41070,6,6.8310` <br> `A_shp,37.65863,-122.30839,11,15.8765` |

### frequencies.txt

File: **Optional**

[Frequencies.txt](#frequenciestxt) represents trips that operate on regular headways (time between trips). This file can be used to represent two different types of service.

* Frequency-based service (`exact_times`=`0`) in which service does not follow a fixed schedule throughout the the day. Instead, operators attempt to strictly maintain predetermined headways for trips.
* A compressed representation of schedule-based service (`exact_times`=`1`) that has the exact same headway for trips over specified time period(s). In schedule-based service operators try to strictly adhere to a schedule.


|  Field Name | Type | Required | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `trip_id` | ID referencing `trips.trip_id` | **Required** | Identifies a trip to which the specified headway of service applies. |
|  `start_time` | Time | **Required** | Time at which the first vehicle departs from the first stop of the trip with the specified headway. |
|  `end_time` | Time | **Required** | Time at which service changes to a different headway (or ceases) at the first stop in the trip. |
|  `headway_secs` | Non-negative integer | **Required** | Time, in seconds, between departures from the same stop (headway) for the trip, during the time interval specified by `start_time` and `end_time`. Multiple headways for the same trip are allowed, but may not overlap. New headways may start at the exact time the previous headway ends.  |
|  `exact_times` | Enum | Optional | Indicates the type of service for a trip. See the file description for more information. Valid options are:<br><br>`0` or empty - Frequency-based trips.<br>`1` - Schedule-based trips with the exact same headway throughout the day. In this case the `end_time` value must be greater than the last desired trip `start_time` but less than the last desired trip start_time + `headway_secs`. |

### transfers.txt

File: **Optional**

When calculating an itinerary, GTFS-consuming applications interpolate transfers based on allowable time and stop proximity. [Transfers.txt](#transferstxt) specifies additional rules and overrides for selected transfers.

|  Field Name | Type | Required | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `from_stop_id` | ID referencing `stops.stop_id` | **Required** | Identifies a stop or station where a connection between routes begins. If this field refers to a station, the transfer rule applies to all its child stops. |
|  `to_stop_id` | ID referencing `stops.stop_id` | **Required** | Identifies a stop or station where a connection between routes ends. If this field refers to a station, the transfer rule applies to all child stops. |
|  `transfer_type` | Enum | **Required** | Indicates the type of connection for the specified (`from_stop_id`, `to_stop_id`) pair. Valid options are:<br><br> `0` or empty - Recommended transfer point between routes.<br>`1` - Timed transfer point between two routes. The departing vehicle is expected to wait for the arriving one and leave sufficient time for a rider to transfer between routes.<br>`2` - Transfer requires a minimum amount of time between arrival and departure to ensure a connection. The time required to transfer is specified by `min_transfer_time`.<br>`3` - Transfers are not possible between routes at the location. |
|  `min_transfer_time` | Non-negative integer | Optional | Amount of time, in seconds, that must be available to permit a transfer between routes at the specified stops. The `min_transfer_time` should be sufficient to permit a typical rider to move between the two stops, including buffer time to allow for schedule variance on each route. |

### pathways.txt

File: **Optional**

The GTFS-Pathways extension uses a graph representation to describe subway or train, with nodes (the locations) and edges (the pathways).

To go from the entrance (which is a node represented as a location with location_type=2) to a platform (which is a node represented as a location with location_type=0), the rider will go through walkway, fare gates, stairs, etc (which are edges represented as pathways). The proposal also adds another type of location, a generic one called "generic node", to represent for example a walkway crossing from which different walkways can be taken.

**Warning: Pathways must be exhaustive in a station.** As consequence, as soon as one platform (as stop), entrance or node belonging to a station has a pathway linked to it, the station is assumed to have exhaustive description of its pathways. Therefore, the following common sense rules apply:
- No dangling location: If any location within a station has a pathway, then all locations should have pathways (except for those platforms that have boarding areas).
- No locked platforms: Each platform must be connected to at least one entrance via some chain of pathways. There are very rare stations in the real life where you cannot go outside.
- No pathways for a platform with boarding areas: A platform that has boarding areas is treated as a parent object, not a point. It may not have pathways assigned. All pathways should be for boarding areas.

|  Field Name | Type | Required | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `pathway_id` | ID | **Required** | The `pathway_id` field contains an ID that uniquely identifies the pathway. The `pathway_id` is used by systems as an internal identifier of this record (e.g., primary key in database), and therefore the `pathway_id` must be dataset unique. <br> Different pathways can go from the same `from_stop_id` to the same `to_stop_id`. For example, this happens when two escalators are side by side in opposite direction, or when a stair is nearby and elevator and both go from the same place to the same place.|
|  `from_stop_id` | ID referencing `stops.stop_id` | **Required** | Location at which the pathway begins. It contains a `stop_id` that identifies a platform, entrance/exit, generic node or boarding area from the `stops.txt` file.|
|  `to_stop_id` | ID referencing `stops.stop_id` | **Required** | Location at which the pathway ends. It contains a `stop_id` that identifies a platform, entrance/exit, generic node or boarding area from the `stops.txt` file.|
|  `pathway_mode` | Enum | **Required** | Type of pathway between the specified (`from_stop_id`, `to_stop_id`) pair. Valid values for this field are: <br> • 1: walkway <br> • 2: stairs <br> • 3: moving sidewalk/travelator <br> • 4: escalator <br> • 5: elevator <br> • 6: fare gate (or payment gate): A pathway that crosses into an area of the station where a proof of payment is required (usually via a physical payment gate).<br>Fare gates may either separate paid areas of the station from unpaid ones, or separate different payment areas within the same station from each other. This information can be used to avoid routing passengers through stations using shortcuts that would require passengers to make unnecessary payments, like directing a passenger to walk through a subway platform to reach a busway. <br> • 7: exit gate: Indicates a pathway exiting an area where proof-of-payment is required into an area where proof-of-payment is no longer required.|
|  `is_bidirectional` | Enum | **Required** | Indicates in which direction the pathway can be used:<br>• 0: Unidirectional pathway, it can only be used from `from_stop_id` to `to_stop_id`.<br>• 1: Bidirectional pathway, it can be used in the two directions.<br><br>Fare gates (`pathway_mode=6`) and exit gates (`pathway_mode=7`) cannot be bidirectional.|
| `length` | Non-negative Float | Optional | Horizontal length in meters of the pathway from the origin location (defined in `from_stop_id`) to the destination location (defined in `to_stop_id`).<br><br>This field is recommended for walkways (`pathway_mode=1`), fare gates (`pathway_mode=6`) and exit gates (`pathway_mode=7`).|
| `traversal_time` | Positive Integer | Optional | Average time in seconds needed to walk through the pathway from the origin location (defined in `from_stop_id`) to the destination location (defined in `to_stop_id`).<br><br>This field is recommended for moving sidewalks (`pathway_mode=3`), escalators (`pathway_mode=4`) and elevator (`pathway_mode=5`).|
| `stair_count` | Non-null Integer | Optional | Number of stairs of the pathway.<br><br>Best Practices: one could use the approximation of 1 floor = 15 stairs to generate approximative values.<br><br>A positive `stair_count` implies that the rider walk up from `from_stop_id` to `to_stop_id`. And a negative `stair_count` implies that the rider walk down from `from_stop_id` to `to_stop_id`.<br><br>This field is recommended for stairs (`pathway_mode=2`).|
| `max_slope` | Float | Optional | Maximum slope ratio of the pathway. Valid values for this field are:<br>• 0 or (empty): no slope.<br>• A float: slope ratio of the pathway, positive for upwards, negative for downwards.<br><br>This field should be used only with walkways (`pathway_type=1`) and moving sidewalks (`pathway_type=3`).<br><br>Example: In the US, 0.083 (also written 8.3%) is the maximum slope ratio for hand-propelled wheelchair, which mean an increase of 0.083m (so 8.3cm) for each 1m.|
| `min_width` | Positive Float | Optional | Minimum width of the pathway in meters.<br><br>This field is highly recommended if the minimum width is less than 1 meter.|
| `signposted_as` | Text | Optional | String of text from physical signage visible to transit riders. The string can be used to provide text directions to users, such as 'follow signs to '. The language text should appear in this field exactly how it is printed on the signs - it should not be translated.|
| `reversed_signposted_as` | Text | Optional | Same than the `signposted_as` field, but when the pathways is used backward, i.e. from the `to_stop_id` to the `from_stop_id`.|

### levels.txt

File: **Optional**

Describe the different levels of a station. Is mostly useful when used in conjunction with `pathways.txt`, and is required for elevator (`pathway_mode=5`) to ask the user to take the elevator to the “Mezzanine” or the “Platform” level.

|  Field Name | Type | Required | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `level_id` | ID | **Required** | Id of the level that can be referenced from `stops.txt`.|
|  `level_index` | Float | **Required** | Numeric index of the level that indicates relative position of this level in relation to other levels (levels with higher indices are assumed to be located above levels with lower indices).<br><br>Ground level should have index 0, with levels above ground indicated by positive indices and levels below ground by negative indices.|
|  `level_name` | Text | Optional | Optional name of the level (that matches level lettering/numbering used inside the building or the station). Is useful for elevator routing (e.g. “take the elevator to level “Mezzanine” or “Platforms” or “-1”).|


### feed_info.txt

File: **Optional**

The file contains information about the dataset itself, rather than the services that the dataset describes. Note that, in some cases, the publisher of the dataset is a different entity than any of the agencies.

|  Field Name | Type | Required | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `feed_publisher_name` | Text | **Required** | Full name of the organization that publishes the dataset. This may be the same as one of the `agency.agency_name` values. |
|  `feed_publisher_url` | URL | **Required** | URL of the dataset publishing organization's website. This may be the same as one of the `agency.agency_url` values. |
|  `feed_lang` | Language code | **Required** | Default language used for the text in this dataset. This setting helps GTFS consumers choose capitalization rules and other language-specific settings for the dataset. |
|  `feed_start_date` | Date | Optional | The dataset provides complete and reliable schedule information for service in the period from the beginning of the `feed_start_date` day to the end of the `feed_end_date` day. Both days can be left empty if unavailable. The `feed_end_date` date must not precede the `feed_start_date` date if both are given. Dataset providers are encouraged to give schedule data outside this period to advise of likely future service, but dataset consumers should treat it mindful of its non-authoritative status. If `feed_start_date` or `feed_end_date` extend beyond the active calendar dates defined in [calendar.txt](#calendartxt) and [calendar_dates.txt](#calendar_datestxt), the dataset is making an explicit assertion that there is no service for dates within the `feed_start_date` or `feed_end_date` range but not included in the active calendar dates. |
|  `feed_end_date` | Date | Optional | (see above) |
|  `feed_version` | Text | Optional | String that indicates the current version of their GTFS dataset. GTFS-consuming applications can display this value to help dataset publishers determine whether the latest dataset has been incorporated. |
|  `feed_contact_email` | Email | Optional | Email address for communication regarding the GTFS dataset and data publishing practices. `feed_contact_email` is a technical contact for GTFS-consuming applications. Provide customer service contact information through [agency.txt](#agencytxt). |
|  `feed_contact_url` | URL | Optional | URL for contact information, a web-form, support desk, or other tools for communication regarding the GTFS dataset and data publishing practices. `feed_contact_url` is a technical contact for GTFS-consuming applications. Provide customer service contact information through [agency.txt](#agencytxt). |
