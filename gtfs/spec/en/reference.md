## Document Conventions

### Term Definitions

This section defines terms that are used throughout this document.

* **Dataset** - A complete set of files defined by this specification reference. Altering the dataset creates a new version of the dataset. Datasets should be published at a public, permanent URL, including the zip file name. (e.g., https://www.agency.org/gtfs/gtfs.zip).
* **Record** - A basic data structure comprised of a number of different field values describing a single entity (e.g. transit agency, stop, route, etc.). Represented, in a table, as a row.
* **Field** - A property of an object or entity. Represented, in a table, as a column.
* **Field value** - An individual entry in a field. Represented, in a table, as a single cell.
* **Service day** - A service day is a time period used to indicate route scheduling. The exact definition of service day varies from agency to agency but service days often do not correspond with calendar days. A service day may exceed 24:00:00 if service begins on one day and ends on a following day. For example, service that runs from 08:00:00 on Friday to 02:00:00 on Saturday, could be denoted as running from 08:00:00 to 26:00:00 on a single service day.
* **Text-to-speech field** - The field should contain the same information than its parent field (on which it falls back if it is empty). It is aimed to be read as text-to-speech, therefore, abbreviation should be either removed ("St" should be either read as "Street" or "Saint"; "Elizabeth I" should be "Elizabeth the first") or kept to be read as it ("JFK Airport" is said abbreviated).

### Presence
Presence conditions applicable to fields and files:
* **Required** - The field or file must be included in the dataset and contain a valid value for each record.
* **Optional** - The field or file may be omitted from the dataset.
* **Conditionally Required** - The field or file must be included under conditions outlined in the field or file description.

### Field Types

- **Color** - A color encoded as a six-digit hexadecimal number. Refer to [https://htmlcolorcodes.com](https://htmlcolorcodes.com) to generate a valid value (the leading "#" is not included). <br> *Example: `FFFFFF` for white, `000000` for black or `0039A6` for the A,C,E lines in NYMTA.*
- **Currency code** - An ISO 4217 alphabetical currency code. For the list of current currency, refer to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active\_codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes). <br> *Example: `CAD` for Canadian dollars, `EUR` for euros or `JPY` for Japanese yen.*
- **Date** - Service day in the YYYYMMDD format. Since time within a service day can be above 24:00:00, a service day often contains information for the subsequent day(s). <br> *Example: `20180913` for September 13th, 2018.*
- **Email** - An email address. <br> *Example: `example@example.com`*
- **Enum** - An option from a set of predefined constants defined in the "Description" column. <br> *Example: The `route_type` field contains a `0` for tram, a `1` for subway...*
- **ID** - An ID field value is an internal ID, not intended to be shown to riders, and is a sequence of any UTF-8 characters. Using only printable ASCII characters is recommended. IDs defined in one .txt file are often referenced in another .txt file. <br> *Example: The `stop_id` field in [stops.txt](#stopstxt) is a ID. The `stop_id` field in [stop_times.txt](#stop_timestxt) is an ID referencing `stops.stop_id`.*
- **Language code** - An IETF BCP 47 language code. For an introduction to IETF BCP 47, refer to [http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) and [http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/](http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/). <br> *Example: `en` for English, `en-US` for American English or `de` for German.*
- **Latitude** - WGS84 latitude in decimal degrees. The value must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to 90.0. *<br> Example: `41.890169` for the Colosseum in Rome.*
- **Longitude** - WGS84 longitude in decimal degrees. The value must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to 180.0. <br> *Example: `12.492269` for the Colosseum in Rome.*
- **Float** - A floating point number.
- **Integer** - An integer.
- **Phone number** - A phone number.
- **Time** - Time in the HH:MM:SS format (H:MM:SS is also accepted). The time is measured from "noon minus 12h" of the service day (effectively midnight except for days on which daylight savings time changes occur). For times occurring after midnight, enter the time as a value greater than 24:00:00 in HH:MM:SS local time for the day on which the trip schedule begins. <br> *Example: `14:30:00` for 2:30PM or `25:35:00` for 1:35AM on the next day.*
- **Text** - A string of UTF-8 characters, which is aimed to be displayed and which must therefore be human readable.
- **Timezone** - TZ timezone from the [https://www.iana.org/time-zones](https://www.iana.org/time-zones). Timezone names never contain the space character but may contain an underscore. Refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_tz\_zones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_tz\_zones) for a list of valid values. <br> *Example: `Asia/Tokyo`, `America/Los_Angeles` or `Africa/Cairo`.*
- **URL** - A fully qualified URL that includes http:// or https://, and any special characters in the URL must be correctly escaped. See the following [http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4\_URI\_Recommentations.html](http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4\_URI\_Recommentations.html) for a description of how to create fully qualified URL values.

### Field Signs
Signs applicable to Float or Integer field types:
* **Non-negative** - Greater than or equal to 0.
* **Non-zero** - Not equal to 0.
* **Positive** - Greater than 0.

_Example: **Non-negative float** - A floating point number greater than or equal to 0._

## Dataset Files

This specification defines the following files:

|  File Name | Presence | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  [agency.txt](#agencytxt) | **Required** | Transit agencies with service represented in this dataset. |
|  [stops.txt](#stopstxt) | **Required** | Stops where vehicles pick up or drop off riders. Also defines stations and station entrances.  |
|  [routes.txt](#routestxt) | **Required** | Transit routes. A route is a group of trips that are displayed to riders as a single service. |
|  [trips.txt](#tripstxt)  | **Required** | Trips for each route. A trip is a sequence of two or more stops that occur during a specific time period. |
|  [stop_times.txt](#stop_timestxt)  | **Required** | Times that a vehicle arrives at and departs from stops for each trip. |
|  [calendar.txt](#calendartxt)  | **Conditionally Required** | Service dates specified using a weekly schedule with start and end dates. <br><br>Conditionally Required:<br> - **Required** unless all dates of service are defined in [calendar_dates.txt](#calendar_datestxt).<br> - Optional otherwise. |
|  [calendar_dates.txt](#calendar_datestxt)  | **Conditionally Required** | Exceptions for the services defined in the [calendar.txt](#calendartxt). <br><br>Conditionally Required:<br> - **Required** if [calendar.txt](#calendartxt) is omitted. In which case [calendar_dates.txt](#calendar_datestxt) must contain all dates of service. <br> - Optional otherwise. |
|  [fare_attributes.txt](#fare_attributestxt)  | Optional | Fare information for a transit agency's routes. |
|  [fare_rules.txt](#fare_rulestxt)  | Optional | Rules to apply fares for itineraries. |
|  [shapes.txt](#shapestxt)  | Optional | Rules for mapping vehicle travel paths, sometimes referred to as route alignments. |
|  [frequencies.txt](#frequenciestxt)  | Optional | Headway (time between trips) for headway-based service or a compressed representation of fixed-schedule service. |
|  [transfers.txt](#transferstxt)  | Optional | Rules for making connections at transfer points between routes. |
|  [pathways.txt](#pathwaystxt)  | Optional | Pathways linking together locations within stations. |
|  [levels.txt](#levelstxt)  | **Conditionally Required** | Levels within stations.<br><br>Conditionally Required:<br>- **Required** when describing pathways with elevators (`pathway_mode=5`).<br>- Optional otherwise. |

## File Requirements

The following requirements apply to the format and contents of the dataset files:

* All files must be saved as comma-delimited text.
* The first line of each file must contain field names. Each subsection of the [Field Definitions](#field-definitions) section corresponds to one of the files in a GTFS dataset and lists the field names that may be used in that file.
* All field names are case-sensitive.
* Field values may not contain tabs, carriage returns or new lines.
* Field values that contain quotation marks or commas must be enclosed within quotation marks. In addition, each quotation mark in the field value must be preceded with a quotation mark. This is consistent with the manner in which Microsoft Excel outputs comma-delimited (CSV) files. For more information on the CSV file format, see [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180).
The following example demonstrates how a field value would appear in a comma-delimited file:
  * **Original field value:** `Contains "quotes", commas and text`
  * **Field value in CSV file:** `"Contains ""quotes"", commas and text"`
* Field values must not contain HTML tags, comments or escape sequences.
* Remove any extra spaces between fields or field names. Many parsers consider the spaces to be part of the value, which may cause errors.
* Each line must end with a CRLF or LF linebreak character.
* Files should be encoded in UTF-8 to support all Unicode characters. Files that include the Unicode byte-order mark (BOM) character are acceptable. See [http://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#BOM](http://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#BOM) for more information on the BOM character and UTF-8.
* All dataset files must be zipped together.

Is called a platform when defined within a `parent_station`.<br>`1` - **Station**. A physical structure or area that contains one or more platform.<br>`2` - **Entrance/Exit**. A location where passengers can enter or exit a station from the street. If an entrance/exit belongs to multiple stations, it can be linked by pathways to both, but the data provider must pick one of them as parent.<br>`3` - **Generic Node**. A location within a station, not matching any other `location_type`, which can be used to link together pathways define in pathways.txt.<br>`4` - **Boarding Area**. A specific location on a platform, where passengers can board and/or alight vehicles.|
|  `parent_station` | ID referencing `stops.stop_id` | **Conditionally Required** | Defines hierarchy between the different locations defined in `stops.txt`.

|  `stop_timezone` | Timezone | Optional | Timezone of the location. If the location has a parent station, it inherits the parent station’s timezone instead of applying its own. Stations and parentless stops with empty `stop_timezone` inherit the timezone specified by `agency.agency_timezone`. If `stop_timezone` values are provided, the times in [stop_times.txt](#stop_timetxt) should be entered as the time since midnight in the timezone specified by `agency.agency_timezone`. This ensures that the time values in a trip always increase over the course of a trip, regardless of which timezones the trip crosses. |
|  `wheelchair_boarding` | Enum | Optional | Indicates whether wheelchair boardings are possible from the location. Valid options are: <br><br>For parentless stops:<br>`0` or empty - No accessibility information for the stop.<br>`1` - Some vehicles at this stop can be boarded by a rider in a wheelchair.<br>`2` - Wheelchair boarding is not possible at this stop. <br><br>For child stops: <br>`0` or empty - Stop will inherit its `wheelchair_boarding` behavior from the parent station, if specified in the parent.<br>`1` - There exists some accessible path from outside the station to the specific stop/platform.<br>`2` - There exists no accessible path from outside the station to the specific stop/platform.<br><br> For station entrances/exits: <br>`0` or empty - Station entrance will inherit its `wheelchair_boarding` behavior from the parent station, if specified for the parent.<br>`1` - Station entrance is wheelchair accessible.<br>`2` - No accessible path from station entrance to stops/platforms. |

Notes on above table:

* On Friday into Saturday morning, for example, a single vehicle operates `trip_1`, `trip_2`, and `trip_3` (10:00 PM through 12:55 AM). Note that the last trip occurs on Saturday, 12:00 AM to 12:55 AM, but is part of the Friday “service day” because the times are 24:00:00 to 24:55:00.
* On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, a single vehicle operates `trip_1`, `trip_4`, and `trip_5` in a block from 8:00 PM to 10:55 PM.

The values must increase along the trip but do not need to be consecutive.<hr>*Example: The first location on the trip could have a `stop_sequence`=`1`, the second location on the trip could have a `stop_sequence`=`23`, the third location could have a `stop_sequence`=`40`, and so on.* |
|  `stop_headsign` | Text | Optional | Text that appears on signage identifying the trip's destination to riders. This field overrides the default `trips.trip_headsign` when the headsign changes between stops. If the headsign is displayed for an entire trip, use `trips.trip_headsign` instead. <br><br>  A `stop_headsign` value specified for one `stop_time` does not apply to subsequent `stop_time`s in the same trip. If you want to override the `trip_headsign` for multiple `stop_time`s in the same trip, the `stop_headsign` value must be repeated in each `stop_time` row. |

### calendar.txt

File: **Conditionally Required**

|  Field Name | Type | Presence | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ |------ |
|  `service_id` | ID | **Required** | Uniquely identifies a set of dates when service is available for one or more routes. Each `service_id` value can appear at most once in a [calendar.txt](#calendartxt) file. |
|  `monday` | Enum | **Required** | Indicates whether the service operates on all Mondays in the date range specified by the `start_date` and `end_date` fields. Note that exceptions for particular dates may be listed in [calendar_dates.txt](#calendar_datestxt). Valid options are:<br><br>`1` - Service is available for all Mondays in the date range.<br>`0` - Service is not available for Mondays in the date range. |
|  `tuesday` | Enum | **Required** | Functions in the same way as `monday` except applies to Tuesdays |
|  `wednesday` | Enum | **Required** | Functions in the same way as `monday` except applies to Wednesdays  |
|  `thursday` | Enum | **Required** | Functions in the same way as `monday` except applies to Thursdays  |

|  `sunday` | Enum | **Required** | Functions in the same way as `monday` except applies to Sundays. |
|  `start_date` | Date | **Required** | Start service day for the service interval. |
|  `end_date` | Date | **Required** | End service day for the service interval. This service day is included in the interval. |

### calendar_dates.txt

File: **Conditionally Required**

The [calendar_dates.txt](#calendar_datestxt) table can explicitly activate or disable service by date. It can be used in two ways.

* Recommended: Use [calendar_dates.txt](#calendar_datestxt) in conjunction with [calendar.txt](#calendartxt) to define exceptions to the default service patterns defined in [calendar.txt](#calendartxt). If service is generally regular, with a few changes on explicit dates (for instance, to accommodate special event services, or a school schedule), this is a good approach. In this case `calendar_dates.service_id` is an ID referencing `calendar.service_id`.
* Alternate: Omit [calendar.txt](#calendartxt), and specify each date of service in [calendar_dates.txt](#calendardatestxt). This allows for considerable service variation and accommodates service without normal weekly schedules. In this case `service_id` is an ID.

|  Field Name | Type | Presence | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `service_id` | ID referencing `calendar.service_id` or ID | **Required** | Identifies a set of dates when a service exception occurs for one or more routes. Each (`service_id`, `date`) pair can only appear once in [calendar_dates.txt](#calendar_datestxt) if using [calendar.txt](#calendartxt) and [calendar_dates.txt](#calendar_datestxt) in conjunction. If a `service_id` value appears in both [calendar.txt](#calendartxt) and [calendar_dates.txt](#calendar_datestxt), the information in [calendar_dates.txt](#calendardatestxt) modifies the service information specified in [calendar.txt](#calendartxt). |
|  `date` | Date | **Required** | Date when service exception occurs. |
|  `exception_type` | Enum | **Required** | Indicates whether service is available on the date specified in the date field. Valid options are:<br><br> `1` - Service has been added for the specified date.<br>`2` - Service has been removed for the specified date.<hr>*Example: Suppose a route has one set of trips available on holidays and another set of trips available on all other days. One `service_id` could correspond to the regular service schedule and another `service_id` could correspond to the holiday schedule. For a particular holiday, the [calendar_dates.txt](#calendar_datestxt) file could be used to add the holiday to the holiday `service_id` and to remove the holiday from the regular `service_id` schedule.* |

### fare_attributes.txt

File: **Optional**

|  Field Name | Type | Presence | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `fare_id` | ID | **Required** | Identifies a fare class. |
|  `price` | Non-negative float | **Required** | Fare price, in the unit specified by `currency_type`. |
|  `currency_type` | Currency code | **Required** | Currency used to pay the fare. |
|  `payment_method` | Enum | **Required** | Indicates when the fare must be paid. Valid options are:<br><br>`0` - Fare is paid on board.<br>`1` - Fare must be paid before boarding. |
|  `transfers` | Enum | **Required** | Indicates the number of transfers permitted on this fare. The fact that this field can be left empty is an exception to the requirement that a Required field must not be empty. Valid options are:<br><br>`0` - No transfers permitted on this fare.<br>`1` - Riders may transfer once.<br>`2` - Riders may transfer twice.<br>empty - Unlimited transfers are permitted. |
|  `agency_id` | ID referencing `agency.agency_id` | **Conditionally Required** | Identifies the relevant agency for a fare. <br><br>Conditionally Required:<br>- **Required** if multiple agencies are defined in `agency.txt`.<br>- Optional otherwise. |
|  `transfer_duration` | Non-negative integer | Optional | Length of time in seconds before a transfer expires. When `transfers`=`0` this field can be used to indicate how long a ticket is valid for or it can be left empty. |

### fare_rules.txt

File: **Optional**

The [fare_rules.txt](#farerulestxt) table specifies how fares in [fare_attributes.txt](#fare_attributestxt) apply to an itinerary. Most fare structures use some combination of the following rules:

* Fare depends on origin or destination stations.
* Fare depends on which zones the itinerary passes through.
* Fare depends on which route the itinerary uses.

For examples that demonstrate how to specify a fare structure with [fare_rules.txt](#farerulestxt) and [fare_attributes.txt](#fareattributestxt), see [https://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/wiki/FareExamples](https://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/wiki/FareExamples) in the GoogleTransitDataFeed open source project wiki.

|  Field Name | Type | Presence | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `fare_id` | ID referencing `fare_attributes.fare_id`  | **Required** | Identifies a fare class. |
|  `route_id` | ID referencing `routes.route_id` | Optional | Identifies a route associated with the fare class. If several routes with the same fare attributes exist, create a record in [fare_rules.txt](#fare_rules.txt) for each route.<hr>*Example: If fare class "b" is valid on route "TSW" and "TSE", the [fare_rules.txt](#fare_rules.txt) file would contain these records for the fare class:* <br> ` fare_id,route_id`<br>`b,TSW` <br> `b,TSE`|
|  `origin_id` | ID referencing `stops.zone_id` | Optional | Identifies an origin zone. If a fare class has multiple origin zones, create a record in [fare_rules.txt](#fare_rules.txt) for each `origin_id`.<hr>*Example: If fare class "b" is valid for all travel originating from either zone "2" or zone "8", the [fare_rules.txt](#fare_rules.txt) file would contain these records for the fare class:* <br> `fare_id,...,origin_id` <br> `b,...,2`  <br> `b,...,8` |
|  `destination_id` | ID referencing `stops.zone_id` | Optional | Identifies a destination zone. If a fare class has multiple destination zones, create a record in [fare_rules.txt](#fare_rules.txt) for each `destination_id`.<hr>*Example: The `origin_id` and `destination_id` fields could be used together to specify that fare class "b" is valid for travel between zones 3 and 4, and for travel between zones 3 and 5, the [fare_rules.txt](#fare_rules.txt) file would contain these records for the fare class:* <br>`fare_id,...,origin_id,destination_id` <br>`b,...,3,4`<br> `b,...,3,5` |
|  `contains_id` | ID referencing `stops.zone_id` | Optional | Identifies the zones that a rider will enter while using a given fare class. Used in some systems to calculate correct fare class. <hr>*Example: If fare class "c" is associated with all travel on the GRT route that passes through zones 5, 6, and 7 the [fare_rules.txt](#fare_rules.txt) would contain these records:* <br> `fare_id,route_id,...,contains_id` <br>  `c,GRT,...,5` <br>`c,GRT,...,6` <br>`c,GRT,...,7` <br> *Because all `contains_id` zones must be matched for the fare to apply, an itinerary that passes through zones 5 and 6 but not zone 7 would not have fare class "c". For more detail, see [https://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/wiki/FareExamples](https://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/wiki/FareExamples) in the GoogleTransitDataFeed project wiki.* |

### shapes.txt

File: **Optional**

Shapes describe the path that a vehicle travels along a route alignment, and are defined in the file shapes.txt. Shapes are associated with Trips, and consist of a sequence of points through which the vehicle passes in order. Shapes do not need to intercept the location of Stops exactly, but all Stops on a trip should lie within a small distance of the shape for that trip, i.e. close to straight line segments connecting the shape points.

|  Field Name | Type | Presence | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `shape_id` | ID | **Required** | Identifies a shape. |
|  `shape_pt_lat` | Latitude | **Required** | Latitude of a shape point. Each record in [shapes.txt](#shapestxt) represents a shape point used to define the shape. |
|  `shape_pt_lon` | Longitude | **Required** | Longitude of a shape point. |
|  `shape_pt_sequence` | Non-negative integer | **Required** | Sequence in which the shape points connect to form the shape. Values must increase along the trip but do not need to be consecutive.<hr>*Example: If the shape "A_shp" has three points in its definition, the [shapes.txt](#shapestxt) file might contain these records to define the shape:* <br> `shape_id,shape_pt_lat,shape_pt_lon,shape_pt_sequence` <br> `A_shp,37.61956,-122.48161,0` <br> `A_shp,37.64430,-122.41070,6` <br> `A_shp,37.65863,-122.30839,11` |
|  `shape_dist_traveled` | Non-negative float | Optional | Actual distance traveled along the shape from the first shape point to the point specified in this record. Used by trip planners to show the correct portion of the shape on a map. Values must increase along with `shape_pt_sequence`; they cannot be used to show reverse travel along a route. Distance units must be consistent with those used in [stop_times.txt](#stop_timestxt).<hr>*Example: If a bus travels along the three points defined above for A_shp, the additional `shape_dist_traveled` values (shown here in kilometers) would look like this:* <br> `shape_id,shape_pt_lat,shape_pt_lon,shape_pt_sequence,shape_dist_traveled` <br> `A_shp,37.61956,-122.48161,0,0`<br>`A_shp,37.64430,-122.41070,6,6.8310` <br> `A_shp,37.65863,-122.30839,11,15.8765` |

### frequencies.txt

File: **Optional**

[Frequencies.txt](#frequenciestxt) represents trips that operate on regular headways (time between trips). This file can be used to represent two different types of service.

* Frequency-based service (`exact_times`=`0`) in which service does not follow a fixed schedule throughout the day. Instead, operators attempt to strictly maintain predetermined headways for trips.
* A compressed representation of schedule-based service (`exact_times`=`1`) that has the exact same headway for trips over specified time period(s). In schedule-based service operators try to strictly adhere to a schedule.


|  Field Name | Type | Presence | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `trip_id` | ID referencing `trips.trip_id` | **Required** | Identifies a trip to which the specified headway of service applies. |
|  `start_time` | Time | **Required** | Time at which the first vehicle departs from the first stop of the trip with the specified headway. |
|  `end_time` | Time | **Required** | Time at which service changes to a different headway (or ceases) at the first stop in the trip. |
|  `headway_secs` | Positive integer | **Required** | Time, in seconds, between departures from the same stop (headway) for the trip, during the time interval specified by `start_time` and `end_time`. Multiple headways for the same trip are allowed, but may not overlap. New headways may start at the exact time the previous headway ends.  |
|  `exact_times` | Enum | Optional | Indicates the type of service for a trip. See the file description for more information. Valid options are:<br><br>`0` or empty - Frequency-based trips.<br>`1` - Schedule-based trips with the exact same headway throughout the day. In this case the `end_time` value must be greater than the last desired trip `start_time` but less than the last desired trip start_time + `headway_secs`. |

### transfers.txt

File: **Optional**

When calculating an itinerary, GTFS-consuming applications interpolate transfers based on allowable time and stop proximity. [Transfers.txt](#transferstxt) specifies additional rules and overrides for selected transfers.

|  Field Name | Type | Presence | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `from_stop_id` | ID referencing `stops.stop_id` | **Required** | Identifies a stop or station where a connection between routes begins. If this field refers to a station, the transfer rule applies to all its child stops. |
|  `to_stop_id` | ID referencing `stops.stop_id` | **Required** | Identifies a stop or station where a connection between routes ends. If this field refers to a station, the transfer rule applies to all child stops. |
|  `transfer_type` | Enum | **Required** | Indicates the type of connection for the specified (`from_stop_id`, `to_stop_id`) pair. Valid options are:<br><br> `0` or empty - Recommended transfer point between routes.<br>`1` - Timed transfer point between two routes. The departing vehicle is expected to wait for the arriving one and leave sufficient time for a rider to transfer between routes.<br>`2` - Transfer requires a minimum amount of time between arrival and departure to ensure a connection. The time required to transfer is specified by `min_transfer_time`.<br>`3` - Transfers are not possible between routes at the location. |
|  `min_transfer_time` | Non-negative integer | Optional | Amount of time, in seconds, that must be available to permit a transfer between routes at the specified stops. The `min_transfer_time` should be sufficient to permit a typical rider to move between the two stops, including buffer time to allow for schedule variance on each route. |

### pathways.txt

File: **Optional**

Files [pathways.txt](#pathwaystxt) and [levels.txt](levelstxt) use a graph representation to describe subway or train stations, with nodes representing locations and edges representing pathways.

To navigate from the station entrance/exit (a node represented as a location with `location_type=2`) to a platform (a node represented as a location with `location_type=0` or empty), the rider will move through walkways, fare gates, stairs, and other edges represented as pathways. Generic nodes (nodes represented with `location_type=3`) can be used to connect pathways throughout a station.

Pathways must be defined exhaustively in a station. If any pathways are defined, it is assumed that all pathways throughout the station are represented. Therefore, the following guidelines apply:
- No dangling locations: If any location within a station has a pathway, then all locations within that station should have pathways, except for platforms that have boarding areas (`location_type=4`, see guideline below).
- No pathways for a platform with boarding areas: A platform (`location_type=0` or empty) that has boarding areas (`location_type=4`) is treated as a parent object, not a point. In such cases, the platform must not have pathways assigned. All pathways should be assigned for each of the platform's boarding areas.
- No locked platforms: Each platform (`location_type=0` or empty) or boarding area (`location_type=4`) must be connected to at least one entrance/exit (`location_type=2`) via some chain of pathways. Stations not allowing a pathway to the outside of the station from a given platform are rare.

|  Field Name | Type | Presence | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `pathway_id` | ID | **Required** | Identifies a pathway. Used by systems as an internal identifier for the record. Must be unique in the dataset. <br><br> Different pathways may have the same values for `from_stop_id` and `to_stop_id`.<hr>_Example: When two escalators are side-by-side in opposite directions, or when a stair set and elevator go from the same place to the same place, different `pathway_id` may have the same `from_stop_id` and `to_stop_id` values._|
|  `from_stop_id` | ID referencing `stops.stop_id` | **Required** | Location at which the pathway begins.<br><br>Must contain a `stop_id` that identifies a platform (`location_type=0` or empty), entrance/exit (`location_type=2`), generic node (`location_type=3`) or boarding area (`location_type=4`).<br><br> Values for `stop_id` that identify stations (`location_type=1`) are forbidden.|
|  `to_stop_id` | ID referencing `stops.stop_id` | **Required** | Location at which the pathway ends.<br><br>Must contain a `stop_id` that identifies a platform (`location_type=0` or empty), entrance/exit (`location_type=2`), generic node (`location_type=3`) or boarding area (`location_type=4`).<br><br> Values for `stop_id` that identify stations (`location_type=1`) are forbidden.|
|  `pathway_mode` | Enum | **Required** | Type of pathway between the specified (`from_stop_id`, `to_stop_id`) pair. Valid options are: <br><br>`1` - Walkway. <br>`2` - Stairs. <br>`3` - Moving sidewalk/travelator. <br>`4` - Escalator. <br>`5` - Elevator. <br>`6` - Fare gate (or payment gate): A pathway that crosses into an area of the station where proof of payment is required to cross. Fare gates may separate paid areas of the station from unpaid ones, or separate different payment areas within the same station from each other. This information can be used to avoid routing passengers through stations using shortcuts that would require passengers to make unnecessary payments, like directing a passenger to walk through a subway platform to reach a busway. <br>`7`-  Exit gate: A pathway exiting a paid area into an unpaid area where proof of payment is not required to cross.|
|  `is_bidirectional` | Enum | **Required** | Indicates the direction that the pathway can be taken:<br><br>`0` - Unidirectional pathway that can only be used from `from_stop_id` to `to_stop_id`.<br>`1` - Bidirectional pathway that can be used in both directions.<br><br>Fare gates (`pathway_mode=6`) and exit gates (`pathway_mode=7`) cannot be bidirectional.|
| `length` | Non-negative float | Optional | Horizontal length in meters of the pathway from the origin location (defined in `from_stop_id`) to the destination location (defined in `to_stop_id`).<br><br>This field is recommended for walkways (`pathway_mode=1`), fare gates (`pathway_mode=6`) and exit gates (`pathway_mode=7`).|
| `traversal_time` | Positive integer | Optional | Average time in seconds needed to walk through the pathway from the origin location (defined in `from_stop_id`) to the destination location (defined in `to_stop_id`).<br><br>This field is recommended for moving sidewalks (`pathway_mode=3`), escalators (`pathway_mode=4`) and elevator (`pathway_mode=5`).|
| `stair_count` | Non-null integer | Optional | Number of stairs of the pathway.<br><br>A positive `stair_count` implies that the rider walk up from `from_stop_id` to `to_stop_id`. And a negative `stair_count` implies that the rider walk down from `from_stop_id` to `to_stop_id`.<br><br>This field is recommended for stairs (`pathway_mode=2`).<br><br>If only an estimated stair count can be provided, it is recommended to approximate 15 stairs for 1 floor.|
| `max_slope` | Float | Optional | Maximum slope ratio of the pathway. Valid options are:<br><br>`0` or empty - No slope.<br>`Float` - Slope ratio of the pathway, positive for upwards, negative for downwards.<br><br>This field should only be used with walkways (`pathway_mode=1`) and moving sidewalks (`pathway_mode=3`).<hr>_Example: In the US, 0.083 (also written 8.3%) is the maximum slope ratio for hand-propelled wheelchair, which mean an increase of 0.083m (so 8.3cm) for each 1m._|
| `min_width` | Positive float | Optional | Minimum width of the pathway in meters.<br><br>This field is recommended if the minimum width is less than 1 meter.|
| `signposted_as` | Text | Optional | Public facing text from physical signage that is visible to riders.<br><br> May be used to provide text directions to riders, such as 'follow signs to '. The text in `singposted_as` should appear exactly how it is printed on the signs.<br><br>When the physical signage is multilingual, this field may be populated and translated following the example of `stops.stop_name` in the field definition of `feed_info.feed_lang`.|
| `reversed_signposted_as` | Text | Optional | Same as `signposted_as`, but when the pathway is used from the `to_stop_id` to the `from_stop_id`.|

Describes levels in a station. Useful in conjunction with `pathways.txt`, and is required for navigating pathways with elevators (`pathway_mode=5`).

|  Field Name | Type | Presence | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `level_id` | ID | **Required** | Identifies a level in a station.|
|  `level_index` | Float | **Required** | Numeric index of the level that indicates its relative position. <br><br>Ground level should have index `0`, with levels above ground indicated by positive indices and levels below ground by negative indices.|
|  `level_name` | Text | Optional | Name of the level as seen by the rider inside the building or station.<hr>_Example: Take the elevator to "Mezzanine" or "Platform" or "-1"._|


### translations.txt

File: **Optional**

In regions that have multiple official languages, transit agencies/operators typically have language-specific names and web pages. In order to best serve riders in those regions, it is useful for the dataset to include these language-dependent values.

|  Field Name | Type | Presence | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `table_name` | Enum | **Required** | Defines the table that contains the field to be translated. Allowed values are:<br><br>- `agency`<br>- `stops`<br>- `routes`<br>- `trips`<br>- `stop_times`<br>- `pathways`<br>- `levels`<br>- `feed_info`<br>- `attributions`<br><br> Any file added to GTFS will have a `table_name` value equivalent to the file name, as listed above (i.e., not including the `.txt` file extension). |
|  `field_name` | Text | **Required** | Name of the field to be translated. Fields with type `Text` can be translated, fields with type `URL`, `Email` and `Phone number` can also be “translated” to provide resources in the correct language. Fields with other types should not be translated. |
|  `language` | Language code | **Required** | Language of translation.<br><br>If the language is the same as in `feed_info.feed_lang`, the original value of the field will be assumed to be the default value to use in languages without specific translations (if `default_lang` doesn't specify otherwise).<hr>_Example: In Switzerland, a city in an officially bilingual canton is officially called “Biel/Bienne”, but would simply be called “Bienne” in French and “Biel” in German._ |
|  `translation` | Text or URL or Email or Phone number | **Required** | Translated value. |
|  `record_id` | ID | **Conditionally Required** | Defines the record that corresponds to the field to be translated. The value in `record_id` should be a main ID of the table, as defined below:<br><br>- `agency_id` for `agency.txt`<br>- `stop_id` for `stops.txt`;<br>- `route_id` for `routes.txt`;<br>- `trip_id` for `trips.txt`;<br>- `trip_id` for `stop_times.txt`;<br>- `pathway_id` for `pathways.txt`;<br>- `level_id` for `levels.txt`;<br>- `attribution_id` for `attribution.txt`.<br><br>No field should be translated in the other tables. However producers sometimes add extra fields that are outside the official specification and these unofficial fields may need to be translated. Below is the recommended way to use `record_id` for those tables:<br><br>- `service_id` for `calendar.txt`;<br>- `service_id` for `calendar_dates.txt`;<br>- `fare_id` for `fare_attributes.txt`;<br>- `fare_id` for `fare_rules.txt`;<br>- `shape_id` for `shapes.txt`;<br>- `trip_id` for `frequencies.txt`;<br>- `from_stop_id` for `transfers.txt`.<br><br>Conditionally Required:<br>- **Forbidden** if `table_name` is `feed_info`.<br>- **Forbidden** if `field_value` is defined.<br>- **Required** if `field_value` is empty. |
|  `record_sub_id` | ID | **Conditionally Required** | Helps the record that contains the field to be translated when the table doesn’t have a unique ID. Therefore, the value in `record_sub_id` is the secondary ID of the table, as defined by the table below:<br><br>- None for `agency.txt`;<br>- None for `stops.txt`;<br>- None for `routes.txt`;<br>- None for `trips.txt`;<br>- `stop_sequence` for `stop_times.txt`;<br>- None for `pathways.txt`;<br>- None for `levels.txt`;<br>- None for `attributions.txt`.<br><br>No field should be translated in the other tables. However producers sometimes add extra fields that are outside the official specification and these unofficial fields may need to be translated. Below is the recommended way to use `record_sub_id` for those tables:<br><br>- None for `calendar.txt`;<br>- `date` for `calendar_dates.txt`;<br>- None for `fare_attributes.txt`;<br>- `route_id` for `fare_rules.txt`;<br>- None for `shapes.txt`;<br>- `start_time` for `frequencies.txt`;<br>- `to_stop_id` for `transfers.txt`.<br><br>Conditionally Required:<br>- **Forbidden** if `table_name` is `feed_info`.<br>- **Forbidden** if `field_value` is defined.<br>- **Required** if `table_name=stop_times` and `record_id` is defined. |
|  `field_value` | Text or URL or Email or Phone number | **Conditionally Required** | Instead of defining which record should be translated by using `record_id` and `record_sub_id`, this field can be used to define the value which should be translated. When used, the translation will be applied when the fields identified by `table_name` and `field_name` contains the exact same value defined in field_value.<br><br>The field must have **exactly** the value defined in `field_value`. If only a subset of the value matches `field_value`, the translation won’t be applied.<br><br>If two translation rules match the same record (one with `field_value`, and the other one with `record_id`), then the rule with `record_id` is the one which should be used.<br><br>Conditionally Required:<br>- **Forbidden** if `table_name` is `feed_info`.<br>- **Forbidden** if `record_id` is defined.<br>- **Required** if `record_id` is empty. |

### feed_info.txt

File: **Optional** (**Required** if `translations.txt` is provided)

The file contains information about the dataset itself, rather than the services that the dataset describes. Note that, in some cases, the publisher of the dataset is a different entity than any of the agencies.

|  Field Name | Type | Presence | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `feed_publisher_name` | Text | **Required** | Full name of the organization that publishes the dataset. This may be the same as one of the `agency.agency_name` values. |
|  `feed_publisher_url` | URL | **Required** | URL of the dataset publishing organization's website. This may be the same as one of the `agency.agency_url` values. |
|  `feed_lang` | Language code | **Required** | Default language used for the text in this dataset. This setting helps GTFS consumers choose capitalization rules and other language-specific settings for the dataset. The file `translations.txt` can be used if the text needs to be translated into languages other than the default one.<br><br>The default language may be multilingual for datasets with the original text in multiple languages. In such cases, the `feed_lang` field should contain the language code `mul` defined by the norm ISO 639-2. The best practice here would be to provide, in `translations.txt`, a translation for each language used throughout the dataset. If all the original text in the dataset is in the same language, then `mul` should not be used.<hr>_Example: Consider a dataset from a multilingual country like Switzerland, with the original `stops.stop_name` field populated with stop names in different languages. Each stop name is written according to the dominant language in that stop’s geographic location, e.g. `Genève` for the French-speaking city of Geneva, `Zürich` for the German-speaking city of Zurich, and `Biel/Bienne` for the bilingual city of Biel/Bienne. The dataset `feed_lang` should be `mul` and translations would be provided in `translations.txt`, in German: `Genf`, `Zürich` and `Biel`; in French: `Genève`, `Zurich` and `Bienne`; in Italian: `Ginevra`, `Zurigo` and `Bienna`; and in English: `Geneva`, `Zurich` and `Biel/Bienne`._ |
|  `default_lang` | Language code | Optional | Defines the language that should be used when the data consumer doesn’t know the language of the rider. It will often be `en` (English). |
|  `feed_start_date` | Date | Optional | The dataset provides complete and reliable schedule information for service in the period from the beginning of the `feed_start_date` day to the end of the `feed_end_date` day. Both days can be left empty if unavailable. The `feed_end_date` date must not precede the `feed_start_date` date if both are given. Dataset providers are encouraged to give schedule data outside this period to advise of likely future service, but dataset consumers should treat it mindful of its non-authoritative status. If `feed_start_date` or `feed_end_date` extend beyond the active calendar dates defined in [calendar.txt](#calendartxt) and [calendar_dates.txt](#calendar_datestxt), the dataset is making an explicit assertion that there is no service for dates within the `feed_start_date` or `feed_end_date` range but not included in the active calendar dates. |
|  `feed_end_date` | Date | Optional | (see above) |
|  `feed_version` | Text | Optional | String that indicates the current version of their GTFS dataset. GTFS-consuming applications can display this value to help dataset publishers determine whether the latest dataset has been incorporated. |
|  `feed_contact_email` | Email | Optional | Email address for communication regarding the GTFS dataset and data publishing practices. `feed_contact_email` is a technical contact for GTFS-consuming applications. Provide customer service contact information through [agency.txt](#agencytxt). |
|  `feed_contact_url` | URL | Optional | URL for contact information, a web-form, support desk, or other tools for communication regarding the GTFS dataset and data publishing practices. `feed_contact_url` is a technical contact for GTFS-consuming applications. Provide customer service contact information through [agency.txt](#agencytxt). |

### attributions.txt

File: **Optional**

The file defines the attributions applied to the dataset.

|  Field Name | Type | Presence | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `attribution_id` | ID | Optional | Identifies an attribution for the dataset or a subset of it. This is mostly useful for translations. |
|  `agency_id` | ID referencing `agency.agency_id` | Optional | Agency to which the attribution applies.<br><br>If one `agency_id`, `route_id`, or `trip_id` attribution is defined, the other ones must be empty. If none of them is specified, the attribution will apply to the whole dataset. |
|  `route_id` |  ID referencing `routes.route_id`  | Optional | Functions in the same way as `agency_id` except the attribution applies to a route. Multiple attributions can apply to the same route. |
|  `trip_id` |  ID referencing `trips.trip_id`  | Optional | Functions in the same way as `agency_id` except the attribution applies to a trip. Multiple attributions can apply to the same trip. |
|  `organization_name` | Text | **Required** | Name of the organization that the dataset is attributed to. |
|  `is_producer` | Enum | Optional | The role of the organization is producer. Valid options are:<br><br>`0` or empty - Organization doesn’t have this role.<br>`1` - Organization does have this role.<br><br>At least one of the fields `is_producer`, `is_operator`, or `is_authority` should be set at `1`. |
|  `is_operator` | Enum | Optional | Functions in the same way as `is_producer` except the role of the organization is operator. |
|  `is_authority` | Enum | Optional | Functions in the same way as `is_producer` except the role of the organization is authority. |
|  `attribution_url` | URL | Optional | URL of the organization. |
|  `attribution_email` | Email | Optional | Email of the organization. |
|  `attribution_phone` | Phone number | Optional | Phone number of the organization. |
