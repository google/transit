### Testing Your GTFS Feeds

Two Open Source tools are available for testing feeds in the GTFS format:

* Use the [feedvalidator tool](https://github.com/google/transitfeed/wiki/FeedValidator) to verify that your feed data file matches the specification defined in this document.
* Use the [schedule_viewer application](https://github.com/google/transitfeed/wiki/ScheduleViewer) to see your feed data represented on a map. This is not representative of how your data will look in other applications; it is a basic tool for testing. Examine routes and schedules to ensure that the data feed correctly represents your system.
