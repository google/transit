This example shows service exceptions for the Independence Day holiday in 2006. On Monday July 3, 2006, regular weekday service (`service_id=WD`) is interrupted (`exception_type=2`). Instead, weekend service (`service_id=WE`) runs on that date (`exception_type=1`). The same change applies on Tuesday July 4, as well.
