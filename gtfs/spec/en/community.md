### Mailing Lists

There are a number of mailing lists that can be good resources when you have questions about public transit data, software, formats like GTFS and GTFS-realtime, and other issues:

* transitfeed: discussion of the open-source transitfeed project, as well of discussion of the GTFS specification and associated tools.
* gtfs-realtime: discussion of the GTFS-realtime specification.
* gtfs-changes: discussion of proposal for extending the GTFS specification, as outlined in the GTFS Changes document.
* transit-developers: general transit developer discussions. Many transit agencies also have their own developer mailing lists specific to the agency. For example:
  * NYC MTA
  * Portland, OR
  * BART - San Francisco, CA
  * MassDOT

Check with your local transit agency to see if they have a mailing list of their own.
