### Mailing Lists

There are a number of mailing lists that can be good resources when you have questions about public transit data, software, formats like GTFS and GTFS-realtime, and other issues:

* [GTFS Changes](https://groups.google.com/group/gtfs-changes): discussion of proposal for extending the GTFS specification, as outlined in the [GTFS Changes document](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/CHANGES.md).
* [GTFS Realtime](https://groups.google.com/group/gtfs-realtime): discussion of the [GTFS-realtime specification](https://github.com/google/transit/tree/master/gtfs-realtime).
* [MobilityData Slack](https://gtfs.slack.com/): Slack "organization" at with channels devoted to GTFS topics. [Request an invite to mobilitydata-io.slack.com here](https://share.mobilitydata.org/slack).
* [transitfeed](https://groups.google.com/group/transitfeed): discussion of the open-source [transitfeed](https://groups.google.com/group/transitfeed) project, as well of discussion of the GTFS specification and associated tools.
* [transit-developers](https://groups.google.com/group/transit-developers): general transit developer discussions. Many transit agencies also have their own developer mailing lists specific to the agency. For example:
    * [NYC MTA](https://groups.google.com/group/mtadeveloperresources)
    * [Portland, OR](https://groups.google.com/group/transit-developers-pdx)
    * [BART - San Francisco, CA](https://groups.google.com/group/bart-developers)
    * [MassDOT](https://groups.google.com/group/massdotdevelopers)
    * [Atlanta, GA region](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/atl-transit-developers)
    * [511 San Francisco Bay Area Developer Resources](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/511sfbaydeveloperresources)

Check with your local transit agency to see if they have a mailing list of their own.
