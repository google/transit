#### March 30, 2009

* A new section on making a transit feed publicly available. This wasn't previously discussed on the group, because it wasn't strictly a change to how the data is interpreted or written. However, some of the folks at Google thought that it would be informative to include discussion of non-Google uses of GTFS, since there are an increasing number of applications that can make use of GTFS-formatted data.
* CSV format clarifications: [discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-changes/03qz5aTA2mk).
* Additional guidance on how to pick contrasting colors in the descriptions of the route_color and route_text_color fields.
* trip_short_name, as proposed and tested in these threads: a and b.
* A fix for a minor error in the sample data included at the end of the document (giving stop S7 the parent_station S8).
* Added "agency_lang" information to the sample data at the end of the document, as suggested by Marcy during the comment period: [discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-changes/5qP1kDUFqx0).
* Updated the link to OCTA's GTFS feed in the sidebar
* See [original summary](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-changes/cL1E4oKKpKw).

* Added agency_phone field for providing voice telephone number for an agency ([original proposal](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gtfs-changes/8Itt58ueyqA))

* Updated example screenshots to reflect the presentation of GTFS fields in the current Google Maps UI
* Updated the Google contact email address for transit data providers
* Updated formatting

#### October 5, 2007

* Added note that calendar.txt can be omitted if all the service dates are defined in calendar_dates.txt.

* Added fuller specification of agency_url, stop_url, and route_url, and additional example values for those fields.
* Added 6 (Gondola) and 7 (Funicular) as valid route_type values.

* Support for mid-trip headsign changes with addition of stop_headsign field in stop_times.txt.
* Support for route colors with addition of optional route_color and route_text_color in routes.txt.
* Removed the ability to specify stops using street addresses. The previous version of the spec allowed you to give the location of a transit stop using a street address in the stop_street, stop_city, stop_region, stop_postcode, and stop_country fields. Now stop locations must be given using stop_lat for latitude and stop_lon for longitude, which are more useful for most applications.
* Addition of cable car vehicle type for route_type field in routes.txt.
* See the original [Headway blog post](http://headwayblog.com/2007/03/02/google-feed-spec-update-2007-02/) summary of the changes.
