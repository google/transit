# Change Process

## Overview

The specification Change Process guides how the community proposes, reviews, and adopts changes to the specification in the [GTFS Repository](https://github.com/google/transit/pulls). 

The specification Change Process is divided into **2 main stages** and categorized into **3 tracks** according to the three [change types](change-types.md): [functional changes](change-types.md/#functional-changes), [non-functional changes](change-types.md/#non-functional-changes), and [documentation maintenance](change-types.md/#documentation-maintenance). 

![](assets/governance-process-overview.svg)

### Stage 1: Issue 

The Issue Stage is meant for discussing new ideas, identifying needs, and proposing improvements to the specification. Issues help evaluate the necessity and support for a change, while organizing the resources required to proceed to the Pull Request Stage. 

It’s recommended to start at the Issue stage to build consensus around new ideas. However, if the proposal’s scope is already well-defined, beginning directly at the Pull Request Stage is appropriate.

### Stage 2: Pull Request 

The Pull Request Stage is where ideas from the Issue Stage are developed and implemented into the specification. This stage is divided into 3 tracks depending on the change type. 

The entire process happens within the [GitHub google/transit repository](https://github.com/google/transit/pulls) and ensures that all changes are thoroughly evaluated before being adopted.

## Process Tracks

Depending on the type of the proposed change, different tracks apply to the Change Process. While the Issue Stage remains the same across all three tracks, the Pull Request Stage varies for each track.

### Track A: Functional Changes

![](assets/governance-process-functional.svg)

This process guides how the community proposes, reviews, and adopts [Functional changes](change-types.md/#functional-changes) to the specification in the [GTFS Repository](https://github.com/google/transit/pulls). 

* A proposal is submitted by opening a Pull Request in the GTFS Repository.   
* The community engages in discussions to refine the proposal. This period must last at least 7 days.
* The [Contributors](roles.md/#contributors) and the [Maintainer](roles.md/#maintainer) review the proposed changes. This period must last at least 7 days.  
* Before testing, the community holds a vote to confirm unanimous consensus on the proposal. This means all participating voters must be in favor. For the vote to be valid, it must include at least five contributors, with a minimum of two Producers and two Consumers. The voting period must last at least 14 days. 
* [First Adopters](roles.md/#first-adopter) test the proposed changes.   
* The community holds a vote to determine whether the changes should be officially adopted. This vote follows an 80% majority rule, meaning at least 80% of votes must be in favor for it to pass. To be valid, the vote must include at least five contributors, with a minimum of two Producers and two Consumers. The voting period must last at least 14 days.
* Finally, changes are implemented into the specification.

### Track B: Non-Functional Changes

![](assets/governance-process-non-functional.svg)

This process guides how the community proposes, reviews, and adopts [Non-Functional changes](change-types.md/#non-functional-changes) to the specification in the [GTFS Repository](https://github.com/google/transit/pulls).

* A proposal is submitted by opening a Pull Request in the GTFS Repository.   
* The community engages in discussions to refine the proposal. This period must last at least 7 days.
* The [Contributors](roles.md/#contributors) and the [Maintainer](roles.md/#maintainer) review the proposed changes. This period must last at least 7 days.   
* The community holds a vote to determine whether the changes should be officially adopted. This vote follows an 80% majority rule, meaning at least 80% of votes must be in favor for it to pass. To be valid, the vote must include at least five contributors, with a minimum of two Producers and two Consumers. The voting period must last at least 14 days.
* Finally, changes are implemented into the specification.

### Track C: Documentation Maintenance

![](assets/governance-process-documentation.svg)

This process guides how the community proposes, reviews, and adopts [changes to maintain the documentation](change-types.md/#documentation-maintenance) in the [GTFS Repository](https://github.com/google/transit/pulls).

* A proposal is submitted by opening a Pull Request in the GTFS Repository.   
* The community engages in discussions to refine the proposal. This period must last at least 7 days.
* The [Contributors](roles.md/#contributors) and the [Maintainer](roles.md/#maintainer) review the proposed changes. This period must last at least 7 days.  
* Finally, changes are implemented into the specification.

## Process Steps

All of the steps in the Issue and Pull Request Stages are highlighted below. Consider that only Track A utilizes all the steps. Track B and Track C utilize a shortened version of the process: 

|  | Track A: Functional Changes | Track B: Non-Functional Changes | Track C: Documentation Maintenance |

### Step 2.1: Pull Request Publication

![](assets/governance-process-step-2.1.svg)

> Note: Applicable to all Tracks 

A proposal to change the specification is published by opening a Pull Request in [the GTFS Repository](https://github.com/google/transit/pulls). The [Advocate](roles.md/#advocate) who publishes the proposal must focus on a single change; anyone is welcome to propose a modification.

**<ins>Actions</ins>** 

1. **Applying the Changes**

    * The [Advocate](roles.md/#advocate) creates a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) of the original [GTFS Repository](https://github.com/google/transit/pulls) to either their personal or their organization’s account.  
    * The [Advocate](roles.md/#advocate) creates a branch in their fork and applies the proposed changes. 

2. **Pull Request Submission**

    * The [Advocate](roles.md/#advocate) creates a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) in the [GTFS Repository](https://github.com/google/transit/pulls) from their fork. 

**<ins>Requirements</ins>**

| Requirement | Details |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Single Change** | The Pull Request should focus on a single change at a time. A "single change" is a self-contained modification with a focused scope, addressing one concept, feature, or rule without bundling unrelated updates. |
| **Extended Description**  | The Pull Request must contain an extended description of the proposed change. It is recommended to follow the provided [Pull Request template](../../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). |
| **Change type** | The Advocate must specify the type of change (Functional, Non-Functional, or Documentation Maintenance) in the opening post of the Pull Request.  <br>- Any contributor can flag a misclassified change at any time to ensure it follows the correct adoption track. <br>- If no consensus is reached, the Maintainer can provide clarification and recommend the appropriate track. |
| **Proposed Discussion Period** | The Advocate should specify a minimum estimated discussion period length based on the scope of the proposed change.  <br>- Example: “I recommend reserving at least one month for discussion to ensure everyone has sufficient time to discuss the proposal.” |
| **Mailing List Announcement** | The Advocate must announce the creation of the Pull Request in the [GTFS Changes mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/gtfs-changes), including: A brief description of the change and a link to the Pull Request. |
